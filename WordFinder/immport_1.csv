Butte, ","""ImmPort, toward repurposing of open access immunological assay data for translational and clinical research."", ",Scientific data ,5 ,(Feb. 2018). ,PUBMED: 29485622; ,DOI 10.1038/sdata.2018.15.,"Immunology researchers are beginning to explore the possibilities of reproducibility, reuse and secondary analyses of immunology data. Open-access datasets are being applied in the validation of the methods used in the original studies, leveraging studies for meta-analysis, or generating new hypotheses. To promote these goals, the ImmPort data repository was created for the broader research community to explore the wide spectrum of clinical and basic research data and associated findings. The ImmPort ecosystem consists of four components-Private Data, Shared Data, Data Analysis, and Resources-for data archiving, dissemination, analyses, and reuse. To date, more than 300 studies have been made freely available through the Shared Data portal (www.immport.org/immport-open), which allows research data to be repurposed to accelerate the translation of new insights into discoveries."
