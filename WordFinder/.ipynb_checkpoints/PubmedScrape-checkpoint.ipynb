      "There is increasing appreciation that the immune system plays critical roles not only in the traditional domains of infection and inflammation but also in many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one of the major barriers for understanding human immunological mechanisms is that immune assays have not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently large and diverse healthy human cohort.

Although some measurement types are sparse in the presently deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP, we describe variations in serum cytokines and leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic changes in pregnancy.

      "Advancements in immunotherapy have improved our understanding of the immune characteristics of breast cancer. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles and clinical data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genes that were differentially expressed between breast tumor tissues and normal breast tissues. Comparisons with the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) indicated that many of the identified differentially expressed genes were immune-related. Risk scores calculated based on an eight-gene signature constructed from these immune-related genes predicted both overall survival and relapse-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. The predictive value of the eight-gene signature was validated in different breast cancer subtypes using external datasets. Associations between risk score and breast cancer immune characteristics were also identified; invitro experiments using breast cancer cell lines confirmed those associations. Thus, the novel eight-gene signature described here accurately predicts breast cancer survival outcomes as well as immune checkpoint expression and immune cell infiltration processes.\n",

      "Background: Immune-related genes (IRGs) are critically involved in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). Here, the study was mainly designed to establish a prognostic model of IRGs to predict the survival of COAD patients. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) database, and Cistrome database were utilized for extracting data regarding the expression of immune gene- and tumor-related transcription factors (TFs), aimed at the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially expressed IRGs (DEIRGs), and differentially expressed TFs (DETFs). Univariate Cox regression analysis was subsequently performed for the acquisition of prognosis-related IRGs, followed by establishment of TF regulatory network for uncovering the possible molecular regulatory association in COAD. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to further determine the role of prognosis-related IRGs for prognostic prediction in COAD. Finally, the feasibility of a prognostic model with immunocytes was explored by immunocyte infiltration analysis. Results: A total of 2450 DEGs, 8 DETFs, and 79 DEIRGs were extracted from the corresponding databases. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed 11 prognosis-related IRGs, followed by establishment of a regulatory network on prognosis-related IRGs at transcriptional levels. Functionally, IRG GLP2R was negatively modulated by TF MYH11, whereas IRG TDGF1 was positively modulated by TF TFAP2A. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was subsequently performed to establish a prognostic model on the basis of seven prognosis-related IRGs (GLP2R, ESM1, TDGF1, SLC10A2, INHBA, STC2, and CXCL1). Moreover, correlation analysis of immunocyte infiltration also revealed that the seven-IRG prognostic model was positively associated with five types of immunocytes (dendritic cell, macrophage, CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and neutrophil), which may directly reflect tumor immune state in COAD. Conclusions: Our present findings indicate that the prognostic model based on prognosis-related IRGs plays a crucial role in the clinical supervision and prognostic prediction of COAD patients at both molecular and cellular levels.\n",

      "We investigated the local immune status and its prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.\n",

      "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common pathological subtype of renal cell carcinoma, and immune-related genes (IRGs) are key contributors to its development. In this study, the gene expression profiles and clinical data of ccRCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the cBioPortal database, respectively. IRGs were obtained from the ImmPort database. We analyzed the expression of IRGs in ccRCC, and discovered 681 that were differentially expressed between ccRCC and normal kidney tissues. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic differentially expressed IRGs (PDEIRGs). Using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we detected seven optimal PDEIRGs (PLAU, ISG15, IRF9, ARG2, RNASE2, SEMA3G and UCN) and used them to construct a risk model to predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. This model accurately stratified patients with different survival outcomes and precisely identified patients with different mutation burdens. Our findings suggest the seven PDEIRGs identified in this study are valuable prognostic predictors in ccRCC patients. These genes could be used to investigate the developmental mechanisms of ccRCC and to design individualized treatments for ccRCC patients.\n",

      "Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with an increasing mortality and morbidity and is considered as an aggressive brain tumor. Recently, extensive studies have been carried out to examine the molecular biology of GBM, and the progression of GBM has been suggested to be correlated with the tumor immunophenotype in a variety of studies. Samples in the current study were extracted from the ImmPort and TCGA databases to identify immune-related genes affecting GBM prognosis. A total of 92 immune-related genes displaying a significant correlation with prognosis were mined, and a shrinkage estimate was conducted on them. Among them, the 14 most representative genes showed a marked correlation with patient prognosis, and LASSO and stepwise regression analysis was carried out to further identify the genes for the construction of a predictive GBM prognosis model. Then, samples in training and test cohorts were incorporated into the model and divided to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the model to predict and classify the prognosis of patients and to identify the relevant immune features according to the median value of RiskScore (namely, Risk-H and Risk-L). In addition, the constructed model was able to instruct clinicians in diagnosis and prognosis prediction for various immunophenotypes.\n",

      "Cervical cancer (CC) has a high incidence and mortality rate, with a low 5-year survival rate, and human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of its carcinogenic risks. However, little evidence exists on the impact of HPV infection on the survival of patients with CC. In the present study, the CC cohort and immune genes were downloaded from the TCGA database and the ImmPort database, respectively. Subsequently, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed and found that HPV status was involved in multiple immune signaling pathways, which revealed that HPV infection might play critical roles in the immune response. Then seven prognostic immune genes were identified according to HPV status in CC. Using the seven immune genes, we established an immune risk score (IRS) signature and the Kaplan-Meier curve showed that high IRS was significantly correlated with poor prognosis of CC in both the training sets (HR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.66-3.33; AUC = 0.712) and the validation sets (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02-1.85 and AUC = 0.583 in TCGA-HNSCC; HR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.364-4.893, AUC = 0.676 in GSE44001). A nomogram of IRS combined with clinical features was established, and further analyses demonstrated that the power of the nomogram to predict the prognosis of CC was more reliable than that of a single independent factor. In conclusion, this study provided a more comprehensive understanding of the correlation between HPV and immune mechanisms as well as a novel signature that can effectively predict the prognosis of CC patients.\n",

Existing approaches in interpreting and using cytometry measurements include manual or automated gating to identify cell subsets from the cytometry data, providing highly intuitive results but may lead to significant information loss, in that additional details in measured or correlated cell signals might be missed. In this study, we propose and test a deep convolutional neural network for analyzing cytometry data in an end-to-end fashion, allowing a direct association between raw cytometry data and the clinical outcome of interest. Using nine large cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry or mass cytometry (CyTOF) studies from the open-access ImmPort database, we demonstrated that the deep convolutional neural network model can accurately diagnose the latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in healthy individuals, even when using highly heterogeneous data from different studies. In addition, we developed a permutation-based method for interpreting the deep convolutional neural network model. We were able to identify a CD27- CD94+ CD8+ T cell population significantly associated with latent CMV infection, confirming the findings in previous studies. Finally, we provide a tutorial for creating, training, and interpreting the tailored deep learning model for cytometry data using Keras and TensorFlow (https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF).\n",

      "The magnitude of the immune response is closely associated with clinical outcome in patients with cancer. However, finding potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer in the immune system remains challenging. Here, we constructed a vital immune-prognosis genes (VIPGs) based cluster of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from IMMPORT databases and The Cancer Genome Atlas. A transcription factor regulatory network for the VIPGs was also established. The tumor microenvironment of LUAD was analyzed using the ESTIMATE (Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) algorithm and single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The immune checkpoints and genomic alterations were explored in the different immune clusters. We identified 15 VIPGs for patients with LUAD and clustered the patients into low-immunity and high-immunity subtypes. The immune score, stromal score and ESTIMATE score were significantly higher in the high-immunity subtype, whereas tumor purity was higher in the low-immunity subtype. In addition, the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T lymphocyte associate protein-4(CTLA4), programmed cell death protein-1 and programmed death-ligand were elevated in the low-immunity subtype. The genomic results also showed that the tumor mutation burden was higher in the high-immunity subtype. Finally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that several immune-related gene sets, including interleukin-2/STAT5 signaling, inflammatory response, interleukin-6/Janus kinase(JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, interferon-gamma response and allograft rejection, were elevated in the high-immunity subtype. Finally, high-immunity patients exhibited greater overall and disease-specific survival outcome compared with low-immunity patients (log rank P = 0.013 and P = 0.0097). Altogether, here we have identified 15 immune-prognosis genes and a potential immune subtype for patients with LUAD, which may provide new insights into the prognosis and treatment of LUAD.\n",

In recent years, immunotherapy for tumors has been widely studied, but a practical prognostic model based on immune-related genes (IRGs) in EC has not been established and reported. This study aimed to develop an immunogenomic risk score for predicting survival outcomes among EC patients. In this study, we downloaded the transcriptome profiling data and matched clinical data of EC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found 4,094 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EC and normal esophageal tissue (p < 0.05 and fold change >2). Then, the intersection of DEGs and the immune genes in the \"ImmPort\" database resulted in 303 differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs). Next, through univariate Cox regression analysis of DEIRGs, we obtained 17 immune genes related to prognosis. We detected nine optimal survival-associated IRGs (HSPA6, CACYBP, DKK1, EGF, FGF19, GAST, OSM, ANGPTL3, NR2F2) by using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, we used those survival-associated IRGs to construct a risk model to predict the prognosis of EC patients. This model could accurately predict overall survival in EC and could be used as a classifier for the evaluation of low-risk and high-risk groups. In conclusion, we identified a practical and robust nine-gene prognostic model based on immune gene dataset. These genes may provide valuable biomarkers and prognostic predictors for EC patients and could be further studied to help understand the mechanism of EC occurrence and development.\n",

This study investigates immune-related gene expression and its prognostic value in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). A cohort of 493 samples of patients with LUSC was collected and analyzed from data generated by the TCGA Research Network and ImmPort database. The R coxph package was employed to mine significant immune-related genes using univariate analysis. Lasso and stepwise regression analyses were used to construct the LUSC prognosis prediction model, and clusterProfiler was used for gene functional annotation and enrichment analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and ROC were used to evaluate the model efficiency in predicting and classifying LUSC case prognoses. We identified 14 immune-related genes to incorporate into our prognosis model. The patients were divided into two subgroups (Risk-H and Risk-L) according to their risk score values. Compared to Risk-L patients, Risk-H patients showed significantly improved overall survival (OS) in both training and testing sets. Functional annotation indicated that the 14 identified genes were mainly enriched in several immune-related pathways. Our results also revealed that a risk score value was correlated with various signaling pathways, such as the JAK-STA signaling pathway. Establishment of a nomogram for clinical application demonstrated that our immune-related model exhibited good predictive prognostic performance. Our predictive prognosis model based on immune signatures has potential clinical implications for assessing the overall survival and precise treatment for patients with LUSC.\n",

Therefore, it is critical to identify potential effective biomarkers for diagnosis of melanoma metastasis. In the present study, the melanoma cohort and immune genes were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the ImmPort database, respectively. Then, we constructed the immune risk score (IRS) using univariate and multivariate logistic analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of IRS in sequencing samples and the initial diagnosis patients was 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. Besides, IRS could add benefits for metastasis diagnosis. For sequencing samples, IRS (OR = 16.35, 95% CI = 8.74-30.59) increased the odds for melanoma metastasis. Similar results were obtained in the initial diagnosis patients (OR = 8.93, 95% CI = 3.53-22.61). A composite nomogram was built based on IRS and clinical information with well-fitted calibration curves. We further used other independent melanoma cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to confirm the reliability and validity of the IRS (AUC > 0.75, OR > 1.04, and P value < 0.01 in all cohorts).

Genomic data and clinical characteristic information of patients with GBM were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazard modeling. Deseq2 software was used for differential expression analysis. Immune-related genes from ImmPort Shared Data and the Cistrome Project were evaluated. The model performance was determined based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. CIBERSORT was used to assess the infiltration of immune cells.

A population of 24 immune-related genes that predicted GBM patient survival was identified. A risk score model established on the basis of the expressions of the 24 immune-related genes was used to evaluate a favorable outcome of GBM. Further validation using the ROC curve confirmed the model was an independent predictor of GBM (AUC = 0.869). In the GBM microenvironment, eosinophils, macrophages, activated NK cells, and follicular helper T cells were associated with prognostic risk.

In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways.

Diagnosis of MTB infection is based on T-cell immune memory to MTB antigens. The MTB proteome contains over four thousand open reading frames (ORFs). We conducted a pilot antigen identification study using 164 MTB proteins and MTB-specific T-cells expanded in vitro from 12 persons with latent MTB infection. Enrichment of MTB-reactive T-cells from PBMC used cell sorting or an alternate system compatible with limited resources. MTB proteins were used as single antigens or combinatorial matrices in proliferation and cytokine secretion readouts. Overall, our study found that 44 MTB proteins were antigenic, including 27 not previously characterized as CD4 T-cell antigens. Antigen truncation, peptide, NTM homology, and HLA class II tetramer studies confirmed malate synthase G (encoded by gene Rv1837) as a CD4 T-cell antigen. This simple, scalable system has potential utility for the identification of candidate MTB vaccine and biomarker antigens.\n",

      "The frequency and duration of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) ocular infections decrease with age, suggesting development of partial immunity. However, there is a lack of clear correlates of immunity to Ct infection in humans. We screened sera from a cohort of Gambian children followed for six-months against a Ct-proteome microarray. At genome sequence level, we detected signatures of selection from a population of ocular Ct isolates from Guinea-Bissau. Together these approaches allowed us to highlight the focus of humoral responses and hypothesise new modes of pathogen immune evasion. Children who were susceptible to frequent and/or prolonged Ct infection had a less focussed antibody response, including preferential recognition of forty-two antigens. There was evidence of positive and purifying selection across the genome, but little balancing selection. In contrast, most antigens that were associated with susceptibility were under neutral selection. These data suggest an evasion strategy in which Ct presents a large panel of irrelevant antigens to the immune system to block or misdirect protective responses. Development of a focused immune response, possibly induced through vaccination, may be an effective strategy to promote protection to Ct infection.\n",

      "The cervix and/or fallopian tubes of pigtailed macaques were experimentally infected with Chlamydia trachomatis. Their sera were collected at varying time points and screened for identification of immunodominant antigens using a whole-genome protein microarray. The effect of doxycycline treatment on the antibody response generated in these macaques was also investigated. Twenty-five female macaques were infected with C. trachomatis serovars D or E in the cervix and/or fallopian tubes. Bloods were collected at baseline and at various intervals after challenge. Serum samples were tested for antibodies using a C. trachomatis serovar D protein microarray. Twenty chlamydial antigens reacted with sera from at least 68% (17/25) of the macaques. In addition to some well-known chlamydial antigens, nine different proteins, not previously recognized as immunodominant, including four hypothetical proteins (CT005, CT066, CT360 and CT578), were identified. Monkeys infected in the fallopian tubes developed a more robust antibody response than animals inoculated in the cervix. Treatment with doxycycline significantly decreased Chlamydia-specific antibody levels. In summary, using protein microarray serum samples from experimentally infected pigtailed macaques were screened for immunodominant chlamydial antigens. These antigens can now be tested in animal models for their ability to protect and as markers of disease progression.\n",

      "A novel Chlamydia muridarum antigen (TC0582) was used to vaccinate BALB/c mice. Mice were also immunized with other components of the ATP synthase complex (TC0580, TC0581, and TC0584), or with the major outer membrane protein (MOMP). TC0582 was also formulated in combination with TC0580, TC0581 or MOMP. TC0582 alone, or in combination with the other antigens, elicited strong Chlamydia-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Vaccinated animals were challenged intranasally and the course of the infection was followed for 10 days. Based on percentage change in body weight, lung weight, and number of Chlamydia inclusion forming units recovered from the lungs, mice immunized with TC0582, TC0581 or MOMP, as single antigens, showed significant protection. Mice immunized with combinations of two antigens were also protected but the level of protection was not additive. TC0582 has sequence homology with the eukaryotic ATP synthase subunit A (AtpA). Therefore, to determine if immunization with TC0582, or with Chlamydia, elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with the mouse AtpA, the two proteins were printed on a microarray. Sera from mice immunized with TC0582 and/or live Chlamydia, strongly reacted with TC0582 but did not recognize the mouse AtpA. In conclusion, TC0582 may be considered as a Chlamydia vaccine candidate. \n",

      "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted pathogen in the world. To identify new vaccine candidates a protein microarray was constructed by expressing the open reading frames (ORFs) from Chlamydia mouse pneumonitis (MoPn). C57BL/6, C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice were immunized either intranasally or intravaginally with live MoPn elementary bodies (EB). Two additional groups were immunized by the intramuscular plus subcutaneous routes with UV-treated EB, using CpG and Montanide as adjuvants to favor a Th1 response, or Alum, to elicit a Th2 response. Serum samples collected from the three strains of mice were tested in the microarray. The array included the expression of 909 proteins from the 921 ORFs of the MoPn genome and plasmid. A total of 530 ORFs were recognized by at least one serum sample. Of these, 36 reacted with sera from the three strains of mice immunized with live EB. These antigens included proteins that were previously described as immunogenic such as MOMP and HSP60. In addition, we uncovered new immunogens, including 11 hypothetical proteins. In summary, we have identified new immunodominant chlamydial proteins that can be tested for their ability to induce protection in animal models and subsequently in humans.\n",

      "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted pathogen in the world. In order to control this infection there is an urgent need to formulate a vaccine. Identification of protective antigens is required to implement a subunit vaccine. To identify potential antigen vaccine candidates, three strains of mice, BALB/c, C3H/HeN and C57BL/6, were inoculated with live and inactivated C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) by different routes of immunization. Using a protein microarray, serum samples collected after immunization were tested for the presence of antibodies against specific chlamydial antigens. A total of 225 open reading frames (ORF) of the C. trachomatis genome were cloned, expressed, and printed in the microarray. Using this protein microarray, a total of seven C. trachomatis dominant antigens were identified (TC0052, TC0189, TC0582, TC0660, TC0726, TC0816 and, TC0828) as recognized by IgG antibodies from all three strains of animals after immunization. In addition, the microarray was probed to determine if the antibody response exhibited a Th1 or Th2 bias. Animals immunized with live organisms mounted a predominant Th1 response against most of the chlamydial antigens while mice immunized with inactivated Chlamydia mounted a Th2-biased response. In conclusion, using a high throughput protein microarray we have identified a set of novel proteins that can be tested for their ability to protect against a chlamydial infection.\n",
