PANNER and CARL R. HONIGFrom the Departments of Pathology and Physiology, University of Rochester, School of Medicineand Dentistry, Rochester, New York 14620ABSTRACTStructures with the characteristics of molecular myosin were identified by electron micros--copy in tissue sections of vertebrate smooth muscle. No thick filaments of myosin were foundregardless of preparative procedures, which included fixation at rest and in contraction,\\nglycerine extraction, and storage at low pH prior to fixation. Absence of thick myosin fila-ments and presence of what appear to be myosin molecules is in accord with conclusions\\nbased on X-ray diffraction (3, 12) and birefringence data (4) from living smooth muscles\\nat rest and in contraction. Explanations are provided for appearances thought by others(6, 20, 21) to represent thick myosin filaments. Our present observations are in accord withthe model for smooth muscle contraction which we have previously proposed(1).INTRODUCTIONWe have previously suggested a contraction hy-pothesis for vertebrate smooth muscle (1) based on\\nthe following electron microscopic observations:(a) All longitudinal filaments in sections of gizzardsmooth muscle are composed of actin. (b) Nothick myosin filaments can be found in tissue sec-tions. (c) Monomers and dimers of myosin exist,both free and attached to actin, in fresh gizzardhomogenates prepared at very low ionic strength,\\neven in the presence of added Ca++ and Mg++(d)Actin filaments are collated by the elliptical,dense bodies into sets which are the equivalent of\\nthe sarcomere of striated muscle. It was suggestedthat contraction occurs through sliding of actin\\nfilaments of opposite sense, driven by interactionwith numerous myosin dimers or tetramers.The foregoing is consistent with observationsbased on filament widths(a),filament counts(b),X-ray crystallography(c),birefringence(d),andsmooth muscle mechanics(e),all of which indicatethat a sliding mechanism is involved. Our hy-52pothesis reconciles these evidences in favor of asliding mechanism with the presence of only one\\ntype of longitudinal filament in fresh homogenatesand tissue sections (1).Failure to find thick myosinfilaments cannot prove their absence. The princi-pal observation we now report is a positive one,namely, that structures with the morphologiccharacteristics of myosin molecules and/or dimersexist in sections of gizzard fixed both at rest and\\nin contraction.METHODSSections of turkey gizzard were prepared for elec-tron microscopy in both methacrylate and Epon as\\ndescribed previously(1). In a recent report by Kellyand Rice (6),prolonged storage and low pH werethought to favor aggregation of myosin into thickfilaments comparable to those of striated muscle.We have attempted to reproduce their results byusing the experimental conditions they described.These conditions include preparation at pH 6.2 and7.4, prolonged storage in glycerin before fixation,Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 23 July 2020use of high concentration of Ca-ATP, and removalof Ca++ by EGTA. Our techniques (1) and those ofKelly and Rice (6) have been previously described.Most electron microscopic images were recorded atprimary magnifications of 50,000. Primary magnifi-cations were checked by photographing a diffractiongrating replica. Final photographic magnificationswere calibrated by using plates of the grating replica\\nto obtain final print magnifications of l00,000-\\n500,000.RESULTSIdentif ca Ion ofIn sectioned material, structures having the ap-pearance of molecular myosin are found (Figs.1-3).A typical molecule is shown at high magnifi-cation in Fig.1, inset.It consists of a head whichappears to be composed of two globular subunitsarranged linearly. Similar head substructure hasbeen described for isolated, shadow-cast myosin\\nby Carney and Brown (7) and by Lowey et al.(8).Dimensions of this particular head are 60 X 120A. The tail is almost aligned in long axis of thehead and can be followed for about 600 A. It is15-20 A wide. Between head and tail a smallbreak in continuity can be seen. The position ofthis break corresponds to the position of the tryp-sin-sensitive \"hinge\" region of the myosin mole-\\ncule. Several other structures with similar mor-phology are seen in Fig. 1 and in other sectionsprepared under different conditions.The four principal morphologic features ofmyosin are again evident in Fig. 2. These are:dimensions, globular head, linear tail, and ap-\\nparent bend and/or break at head-tail junction.Fig.2wasphotographicallyenlargedto500,000 X, the highest magnification we have em-\\nployed. Images which we interpret as myosinmolecules stand out as structures of uniformly de-\\ncreased electron opacity against a darker globular\\nbackground. The qualitative difference in electronopacity of the myosin molecules shown in Figs. 1and 2 is attributable to uncontrolled variations infocus, phase contrast, section thickness, intensity\\nof heavy metal staining, and possibly other physi-\\ncal factors. It has been our experience that pri-mary magnifications of 50,000 or more are neces-\\nsary for resolution of the myosin molecule in thin\\ntissue sections. Neither in Figs. I and 2 nor in anyother electron micrograph of sectioned gizzard\\nhave we been able to identify thick filaments of\\nmyosin.Effect of Preparative Conditions onAppearance of MyosinFIXATION,EMBEDDINGANDSTAININGUse of glutaraldehyde without osmium tetroxideFIGURE 1Longitudinal section of gizzard smooth muscle fixed in glutaraldehyde buffered to pII 6.2immediately after removal and embedded in Epon.

This width is con-sistent with the dimensions of actin. Under all theabove conditions structures with the morphologi-\\ncal characteristics of myosin molecules could be\\nidentified.itsEffectofStorage, Glycerination, and pHMuscles trimmed to 1-2 mm in width and 1 emin length were stored at rest length at -20•C forup to 4 months in 500%oglycerol buffered at pH 7.4.These specimens showed no areas of empty cyto-plasm and only slight disruption of cytomem-\\nbranes. Filament ultrastructure in sections fromsuch tissue blocks is in no way different from thatillustrated in Figs. 1, 3, and 4, which were ob-tained from muscles fixed immediately upon re-moval from the animal. In contrast, comparablemuscle samples stored for 4 months at -20•C in\\nglycerol buffered at pH 6.2 showed extensivetissue alteration even to the naked eye; the muscleblocks were decolorized and translucent. There iscomplete absence of recognizable ultrastructure in\\nsections prepared from these blocks, except for a\\nfew nuclear fragments and cytoplasmic debris.Muscles fixed after 1 wk of storage at -20•C in\\nglycerol buffered at pH 6.2 were not decolorized,but sections taken from the superficial layers of thespecimen blocks reveal loss of filament ultrastruc-ture and partial disruption of cytomembranes.

No Ca-\"+ wasadded to the extraction medium, but the concen-\\ntration of ionized contaminant Ca++ was between5 X 10-s and I X 10-5M.These concentrationsfully activate the actomyosin ATPase, promotesuperprecipitation of gizzard myosin B, and maxi-\\nmally activate the ATPase of glycerinated gizzard\\nmyofibrils (unpublished observations). No thickmyosin filaments are observed in sections of gizzard\\nsoaked either at pH 7.4 or 6.2. Instead, individualmyosin molecules are found in longitudinal and incross sections (Fig. 5). Fig.5,inset,at higher mag-nification, shows what appears to be a myosinmolecule with two tails, similar to Fig. 6 ofCarney and Brown(7).It is not possible to meas-ure the individual tails with sufficient accuracy todetermine whether these may represent separation\\nof a two-stranded structure or superimposition.56\\nTHE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY-VOLUME 44, 1970Myosin in Fresh HomogenatesGizzards were homogenized in 50 mm KCl,20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and the homogenateswere examined within 15 min by negative staining\\n(1).No myosin aggregates were observed, even if5 X 10-4MCa++ was added and up to 10 mm Mgwas present. On one occasion spindle-shaped struc-tures devoid of projections and up to 2300 A long\\nand 200 A wide were found (Fig. 6). These exhibitlongitudinal substructure but no axial periodicity,\\nas in the \"needles\" of light meromyosin shown in\\nPlate XV (b) of Huxley(11).Thus we can obtainaggregates from freshly homogenized gizzard, but\\nonly if catheptic activity is present, as indicated by\\nloss of myosin heads.ActinSmooth muscle fixed in glutaraldehyde exhibitsuniform longitudinal filaments with regular inter-\\nfilament spacing (Fig. 7; reference 1, Fig. 2). Theregular interfilament distance of 110-120 A is in\\nremarkably good agreement with values obtained\\nby Elliott and Lowy (12) for living taenia coli\\nfrom low angle X-ray diffraction diagrams. Thisregularity of packing appears responsible for the\\nhigh form birefringence of vertebrate smooth\\nmuscles(4).Primary fixation in osmium tetroxiderather than glutaraldehyde leads to variability inelectron opacity of individual actin filaments (1)and destroys the regularity of filament spacingwhich exists in vivo (12).Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 23 July 2020FIGURE 6Specimen from gizzard homogenized in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, without addedMg++ or ATP; contaminant Ca++ was about 10-5M.Negatively stained about 15 min after homogeniza-tion.

Thebest resolution obtainable in conventional elec-\\ntron microscopy of stained, sectioned tissue isabout 20 A. Only in exceptional cases can thisperformance be significantly improved(16).Sincemyosin heads are about 20-30 A wide, and the tailis about 15 A wide, it is clear that we are working\\nat about the practical limits of the method in the\\npresent study. Though the pictures reflect thisfact, it is nevertheless possible to identify the\\ncharacteristic morphological features of myosin.We have tried to improve definition of myosinin the final prints by use of optical filtration(17).Unfortunately, enhancement of high frequencies\\ncharacteristic of myosin tails obscures ovoid myo-sin heads, and enhancement of low frequencies toimprove resolution of heads eliminates the tails.Spatial filtering of Fig. 7, which was designed toenhance structures oriented at an angle to the\\nlongitudinal actin filaments, made possible visual-ization of images thought to be myosin which werenot observable in conventional prints. Fig. 3 alsoindicates that the predominant actin filamentstend to obscure myosin. It is therefore unlikelythat the amount of myosin could ever be judged\\nfrom electron micrographs. The amount whichcould be accommodated by the arrangement we\\npropose (1) seems sufficient, however, to accountfor the myosin found by chemical analysis(18).Problems of resolution are compounded bypossible disruption of molecular structure duringspecimen preparation. Our inability to observelengths greater than about 1200 A in the plane ofsection, in addition to the foregoing technicalfactors, render it impossible to determine whetherthe long myosin tails seen in sectioned smooth58 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY•VOLUME 44, 1970muscle existed in vivo as individual molecules oras side-side or end-end dimers as required by the\\ncontraction mechanism we have proposed(1).Results of OthersTHICK FILAMENTS FROM HOMOGENATES:Several investigators have reported that thick fila-\\nments can be produced in vitro by lowering the\\nionic strength of solutions of smooth muscle myosin(6, 19, 20, 21). These filaments tend to be some-what shorter than those obtainable from striated\\nmuscle and exhibit widths ranging from 110-\\n250 A. In our experience, fresh, negatively stainedgizzard homogenates do not contain thick myosin\\nfilaments.Occurrenceoflightmeromyosin\"crystals\" in some homogenates (Fig. 6) indicateshow rapidly smooth muscle myosin can be de-\\ngraded in vitro. It is therefore not surprising thatin aged preparations (6) or in those deliberately\\ntreated with a proteolytic enzyme (20) thick fila-\\nments may be found. Even skeletal muscle myosin,which normally remains in molecular form at high\\nionic strength, will aggregate in 0.6MKCl uponaging.Further evidence that thick myosin filaments donot exist in living smooth muscle arises from com-\\nparison of width of thick filaments with the 110-125 A interactin distances observed by X-raydiffraction (12) and electron microscopy (Fig. 7).The maximum interactin distance in such a lattice\\nwould be about 180 A. A functional myosin aggre-gate must therefore be less than 180 A in diameter,\\nbut some structures thought by others to be thick\\nfilaments of myosin are of considerably greater\\nwidth(6,21).Filaments between 110 A and 180 Acould be accommodated in the regular interactin\\nspaces of living smooth muscle, but only if the ar-\\nrangement of thick filaments is also regular. Such\\n\\nregularly spaced large myosin filaments might be\\nexpected to yield reflections in X-ray diffractiondiagrams, and in electron micrographs the crosssections should resemble A bands. No myosin re-\\n\\nflections have ever been observed by X-ray diffrac-\\ntion, nor has regularity of spacing been demon-\\nstrated among thick filaments purported to be\\nmyosin.If thick myosin filaments do not exist in vivo,how can one account for the thick filaments which\\nhave been reported in sectioned smooth muscle(6, 21, 22)? Upon careful examination of thesestructures we conclude that they cannot be identi-\\nfied as myosin on the basis of their substructure.Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 23 July 2020Since thick filaments can readily be produced insmooth muscle sections as preparative artifacts, wesuggest that the following criteria be met before\\nconcluding that a thick filamentous structureisindeed composed of myosin:(a) The spacing of thin actin filaments shouldbe regular.(b) Order should be demonstrable in the ar-rangement of thick filaments, with respect both to\\neach other and to actin.(c) Magnification and resolution should be ade-quate to identify the substructure of the myosin\\naggregate, namely projections characteristic of\\nmyosin heads, bare central region,and distaltaper. In most previous studies of sectioned verte-brate smooth muscle, magnifications have been\\nused which are too low to visualize molecular di-\\nmensions and, indeed, often too low for accurate\\nmeasurement of filament width.(d) Technique should be adequate to resolvethe globular substructure of actin filaments,inorder to further exclude the possibility that thick\\nfilaments about 140 A in diameter are due to side-\\nto-side association of two actin filaments,or toformation of a compound actomyosin filament.(e) The diameter of presumed myosin filamentsin sectioned muscle should not exceed the maxi-\\nmum diameter of aggregates of smooth muscle\\nmyosin produced synthetically in vitro.Review of all published electron micrographsthat are thought to demonstrate thick filaments of\\nmyosin have failed to reveal any filaments which\\nmeet the above criteria. The thick filaments re-cently described by Kelly and Rice (6) are ran-\\ndomly distributed. Large areas of their sectionscontain no thick filaments, and some areas are de-void of all filaments (Figs. 8 and 12 of reference 6).Figs. 1, 2, and 4 of Nonomura (21) also demon-strate randomly arranged thick filaments of vari-able diameter, with minimum distances between\\nthick filaments of about 700 A. In cross-section,structures identified by Nonomura as thick fila-ments are resolvable into contiguous ovoid densities\\neach with dimensions characteristic of actin. Themean filament diameter for the primary peak in\\nNonomura\\'s bimodal frequencydistribution offilament diameters is consistent with actin dimen-sions, and the mean diameter for the small sec-ondary peak is about twice the primary one, again\\nsuggesting side-to-side apposition of actin.Actinshows strong electrical birefringence (23) and maybe held in its regular array in vivo by mutual re-pulsion provided by fixed charges along the fila-\\nments (12).Charge neutralization by preparativetechniques could account for loss of regular actin\\nfilament spacing andapposition of filaments.Kelly and Rice attribute the presence of thickfilaments in their sections to aggregation of myosin\\nduring prolonged storage of thespecimens inglycerin at pH 5.8-6.6(6).In our experience,however, glycerination at pH 6.2 for even Iwkresulted in disruption of normal ultrastructure in\\nthe superficial portions of the tissue blocks, and\\nmaterial so stored for 4 months showed loss of\\nultrastructure throughout the specimen. We canreadily find molecules of myosin in superficial por-\\ntions of specimens stored briefly at pH 6.2 and inthe relatively intact central portionsof blocksstored at pH 6.2 for up to I wk. Perhaps the blockswhich Kelly and Rice stored for 6 months were\\nsufficiently large to provide less damaged tissue in\\nthe depths of the specimen, but is is difficult to\\nknow what the pH might have been in these\\nusable portions.Shoenberg (20)has recently proposedthatmyosin exists in molecular form in resting smoothmuscle and reversibly aggregates into thick fila-ments when activation raises intracellular Ca++Though one cannot exclude the possibility of con-\\ntraction-coupled aggegation of myosin, itseemsextremely unlikely. The belief that smooth musclecells contract slowly enough to permit reversible\\naggregation of myosin is based on older data for\\ntetanic contractions inlarge cell populations\\n.When a single action potential in an individual\\nsmooth muscle cell is correlated with the tension\\ndeveloped by very small populations of cells, the\\ntime course of the twitch is comparable to that of a\\nslow skeletal muscle. For example, peak twitchtension in a 5 mm strip of taenia coli (24) and in a\\nstrip of fowl anterior mesenteric artery(25) isattained in about 500 msec. Time until onset ofcontraction should be even shorter, especially if it\\nwere possible to eliminate conduction time in the\\nstrips by correlating electrical and mechanical\\nevents for a single cell. Minimum time for aggre-gation of smooth muscle myosin in vitro is aboutI min(20).We conclude that smooth muscle con-traction is at least 100 times too fast to be ex-\\nplained by reversible, contraction-coupled aggre-gation of myosin. Direct evidence against the ideaof contraction-coupled aggregation is the fact thatliving vertebrate smooth muscle exhibits no change\\nin birefringence during isometric contraction(4).BERNARD PANNER AND CARL HONIGVertebrate Smooth Muscle Myosin59Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 23 July 2020The birefringence data are consistent with evi-dence from X-ray diffraction in living and fixedsmooth muscles (3, 11) and with the electron\\nmicroscopic findings described in this paper.Whether apparent failure of smooth muscle myo-\\nsin to aggregate in vivo is a property of the indi-\\nvidual myosin molecules or of a controlling re-\\nactant, such as a recently described myosin\\naggregation factor(26),remains to be determined.Ultrastructure and Contraction MechanismThe existence of myosin in relatively unaggre-gated form (dimers or tetramers) is consistent with\\nthe contraction mechanism we have previouslysuggested(1).In our view, shortening is attribu-table to interdigitation and sliding of actin fila-ments of opposite sense. Motion is imparted bynumerous myosin dimers which form linkages be-tween actin filaments. Asynchronous making andbreaking of links along the entire free length of\\nactin outside the dense body allows for sustained\\ntension even though individual dimers become dis-\\nconnected during shortening. A similar mechanism\\n\\nmay underlie movement in slime molds (27) and\\nin other primitive motile systems in which acto-\\nmyosin-like proteins have been described (28, 29,\\n30).Two pieces of evidence crucial to proof of thishypothesis are still missing. Myosin dimers havenot been visualized in tissue sections of smoothmuscle, for reasons cited above, though they havebeen found in fresh homogenates(1).Secondly,REFERENCES1. PANNER, B. J., and C. R.

Thehypothesis is nevertheless consistent with all pres-ent biochemical and ultrastructural observations,and it accounts for the broad length optimum for\\ntension development so characteristic of smoothmuscle(5).In striated muscles maximum tensionis developed only over the small range of sarco-mere lengths within which actin and myosin sites\\noverlap to a maximum extent. This range is de-termined by the length of the bare central zone\\nof the A band filament(31).Smooth muscle, incontrast, subserves functions which require much\\nlarger per cent changes in length. In the moleculararrangement we propose, actin and myosin can\\ninteract over at least 2‡,or more than 10 timesthe length of the bare zone of the A band filament.We therefore regard maintenance of myosin in un-\\naggregated form as an adaptation which facilitates\\nshortening by increasing the range of lengths over\\nwhich tension-generating actomyosin linkages can\\nbe formed.We thank Dr. Clarence N.

Explanations are provided for appearances thought by others(6, 20, 21) to represent thick myosin filaments. Our present observations are in accord withthe model for smooth muscle contraction which we have previously proposed(1).INTRODUCTIONWe have previously suggested a contraction hy-pothesis for vertebrate smooth muscle (1) based on\\nthe following electron microscopic observations:(a) All longitudinal filaments in sections of gizzardsmooth muscle are composed of actin. (b) Nothick myosin filaments can be found in tissue sec-tions. (c) Monomers and dimers of myosin exist,both free and attached to actin, in fresh gizzardhomogenates prepared at very low ionic strength,\\neven in the presence of added Ca++ and Mg++(d)Actin filaments are collated by the elliptical,dense bodies into sets which are the equivalent of\\nthe sarcomere of striated muscle. It was suggestedthat contraction occurs through sliding of actin\\nfilaments of opposite sense, driven by interactionwith numerous myosin dimers or tetramers.The foregoing is consistent with observationsbased on filament widths(a),filament counts(b),X-ray crystallography(c),birefringence(d),andsmooth muscle mechanics(e),all of which indicatethat a sliding mechanism is involved. Our hy-52pothesis reconciles these evidences in favor of asliding mechanism with the presence of only one\\ntype of longitudinal filament in fresh homogenatesand tissue sections (1).Failure to find thick myosinfilaments cannot prove their absence. The princi-pal observation we now report is a positive one,namely, that structures with the morphologiccharacteristics of myosin molecules and/or dimersexist in sections of gizzard fixed both at rest and\\nin contraction.METHODSSections of turkey gizzard were prepared for elec-tron microscopy in both methacrylate and Epon as\\ndescribed previously(1). In a recent report by Kellyand Rice (6),prolonged storage and low pH werethought to favor aggregation of myosin into thickfilaments comparable to those of striated muscle.We have attempted to reproduce their results byusing the experimental conditions they described.These conditions include preparation at pH 6.2 and7.4, prolonged storage in glycerin before fixation,Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 20 July 2020use of high concentration of Ca-ATP, and removalof Ca++ by EGTA. Our techniques (1) and those ofKelly and Rice (6) have been previously described.Most electron microscopic images were recorded atprimary magnifications of 50,000. Primary magnifi-cations were checked by photographing a diffractiongrating replica. Final photographic magnificationswere calibrated by using plates of the grating replica\\nto obtain final print magnifications of l00,000-\\n500,000.RESULTSIdentif ca Ion ofIn sectioned material, structures having the ap-pearance of molecular myosin are found (Figs.1-3).A typical molecule is shown at high magnifi-cation in Fig.1, inset.It consists of a head whichappears to be composed of two globular subunitsarranged linearly. Similar head substructure hasbeen described for isolated, shadow-cast myosin\\nby Carney and Brown (7) and by Lowey et al.(8).Dimensions of this particular head are 60 X 120A. The tail is almost aligned in long axis of thehead and can be followed for about 600 A. It is15-20 A wide. Between head and tail a smallbreak in continuity can be seen. The position ofthis break corresponds to the position of the tryp-sin-sensitive \"hinge\" region of the myosin mole-\\ncule. Several other structures with similar mor-phology are seen in Fig. 1 and in other sectionsprepared under different conditions.The four principal morphologic features ofmyosin are again evident in Fig. 2. These are:dimensions, globular head, linear tail, and ap-\\nparent bend and/or break at head-tail junction.Fig.2wasphotographicallyenlargedto500,000 X, the highest magnification we have em-\\nployed. Images which we interpret as myosinmolecules stand out as structures of uniformly de-\\ncreased electron opacity against a darker globular\\nbackground. The qualitative difference in electronopacity of the myosin molecules shown in Figs. 1and 2 is attributable to uncontrolled variations infocus, phase contrast, section thickness, intensity\\nof heavy metal staining, and possibly other physi-\\ncal factors. It has been our experience that pri-mary magnifications of 50,000 or more are neces-\\nsary for resolution of the myosin molecule in thin\\ntissue sections. Neither in Figs.

This width is con-sistent with the dimensions of actin.

Filament ultrastructure in sections fromsuch tissue blocks is in no way different from thatillustrated in Figs. 1, 3, and 4, which were ob-tained from muscles fixed immediately upon re-moval from the animal.

No Ca-\"+ wasadded to the extraction medium, but the concen-\\ntration of ionized contaminant Ca++ was between5 X 10-s and I X 10-5M.These concentrationsfully activate the actomyosin ATPase, promotesuperprecipitation of gizzard myosin B, and maxi-\\nmally activate the ATPase of glycerinated gizzard\\nmyofibrils (unpublished observations). No thickmyosin filaments are observed in sections of gizzard\\nsoaked either at pH 7.4 or 6.2. Instead, individualmyosin molecules are found in longitudinal and incross sections (Fig. 5). Fig.5,inset,at higher mag-nification, shows what appears to be a myosinmolecule with two tails, similar to Fig. 6 ofCarney and Brown(7).It is not possible to meas-ure the individual tails with sufficient accuracy todetermine whether these may represent separation\\nof a two-stranded structure or superimposition.56\\nTHE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY-VOLUME 44, 1970Myosin in Fresh HomogenatesGizzards were homogenized in 50 mm KCl,20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and the homogenateswere examined within 15 min by negative staining\\n(1).No myosin aggregates were observed, even if5 X 10-4MCa++ was added and up to 10 mm Mgwas present. On one occasion spindle-shaped struc-tures devoid of projections and up to 2300 A long\\nand 200 A wide were found (Fig. 6). These exhibitlongitudinal substructure but no axial periodicity,\\nas in the \"needles\" of light meromyosin shown in\\nPlate XV (b) of Huxley(11).Thus we can obtainaggregates from freshly homogenized gizzard, but\\nonly if catheptic activity is present, as indicated by\\nloss of myosin heads.ActinSmooth muscle fixed in glutaraldehyde exhibitsuniform longitudinal filaments with regular inter-\\nfilament spacing (Fig. 7; reference 1, Fig. 2). Theregular interfilament distance of 110-120 A is in\\nremarkably good agreement with values obtained\\nby Elliott and Lowy (12) for living taenia coli\\nfrom low angle X-ray diffraction diagrams. Thisregularity of packing appears responsible for the\\nhigh form birefringence of vertebrate smooth\\nmuscles(4).Primary fixation in osmium tetroxiderather than glutaraldehyde leads to variability inelectron opacity of individual actin filaments (1)and destroys the regularity of filament spacingwhich exists in vivo (12).Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 20 July 2020FIGURE 6Specimen from gizzard homogenized in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, without addedMg++ or ATP; contaminant Ca++ was about 10-5M.Negatively stained about 15 min after homogeniza-tion.

Thebest resolution obtainable in conventional elec-\\ntron microscopy of stained, sectioned tissue isabout 20 A. Only in exceptional cases can thisperformance be significantly improved(16).Sincemyosin heads are about 20-30 A wide, and the tailis about 15 A wide, it is clear that we are working\\nat about the practical limits of the method in the\\npresent study. Though the pictures reflect thisfact, it is nevertheless possible to identify the\\ncharacteristic morphological features of myosin.We have tried to improve definition of myosinin the final prints by use of optical filtration(17).Unfortunately, enhancement of high frequencies\\ncharacteristic of myosin tails obscures ovoid myo-sin heads, and enhancement of low frequencies toimprove resolution of heads eliminates the tails.Spatial filtering of Fig. 7, which was designed toenhance structures oriented at an angle to the\\nlongitudinal actin filaments, made possible visual-ization of images thought to be myosin which werenot observable in conventional prints. Fig. 3 alsoindicates that the predominant actin filamentstend to obscure myosin. It is therefore unlikelythat the amount of myosin could ever be judged\\nfrom electron micrographs. The amount whichcould be accommodated by the arrangement we\\npropose (1) seems sufficient, however, to accountfor the myosin found by chemical analysis(18).Problems of resolution are compounded bypossible disruption of molecular structure duringspecimen preparation. Our inability to observelengths greater than about 1200 A in the plane ofsection, in addition to the foregoing technicalfactors, render it impossible to determine whetherthe long myosin tails seen in sectioned smooth58 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY•VOLUME 44, 1970muscle existed in vivo as individual molecules oras side-side or end-end dimers as required by the\\ncontraction mechanism we have proposed(1).Results of OthersTHICK FILAMENTS FROM HOMOGENATES:Several investigators have reported that thick fila-\\nments can be produced in vitro by lowering the\\nionic strength of solutions of smooth muscle myosin(6, 19, 20, 21). These filaments tend to be some-what shorter than those obtainable from striated\\nmuscle and exhibit widths ranging from 110-\\n250 A. In our experience, fresh, negatively stainedgizzard homogenates do not contain thick myosin\\nfilaments.Occurrenceoflightmeromyosin\"crystals\" in some homogenates (Fig. 6) indicateshow rapidly smooth muscle myosin can be de-\\ngraded in vitro. It is therefore not surprising thatin aged preparations (6) or in those deliberately\\ntreated with a proteolytic enzyme (20) thick fila-\\nments may be found. Even skeletal muscle myosin,which normally remains in molecular form at high\\nionic strength, will aggregate in 0.6MKCl uponaging.Further evidence that thick myosin filaments donot exist in living smooth muscle arises from com-\\nparison of width of thick filaments with the 110-125 A interactin distances observed by X-raydiffraction (12) and electron microscopy (Fig. 7).The maximum interactin distance in such a lattice\\nwould be about 180 A. A functional myosin aggre-gate must therefore be less than 180 A in diameter,\\nbut some structures thought by others to be thick\\nfilaments of myosin are of considerably greater\\nwidth(6,21).Filaments between 110 A and 180 Acould be accommodated in the regular interactin\\nspaces of living smooth muscle, but only if the ar-\\nrangement of thick filaments is also regular. Such\\n\\nregularly spaced large myosin filaments might be\\nexpected to yield reflections in X-ray diffractiondiagrams, and in electron micrographs the crosssections should resemble A bands. No myosin re-\\n\\nflections have ever been observed by X-ray diffrac-\\ntion, nor has regularity of spacing been demon-\\nstrated among thick filaments purported to be\\nmyosin.If thick myosin filaments do not exist in vivo,how can one account for the thick filaments which\\nhave been reported in sectioned smooth muscle(6, 21, 22)? Upon careful examination of thesestructures we conclude that they cannot be identi-\\nfied as myosin on the basis of their substructure.Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 20 July 2020Since thick filaments can readily be produced insmooth muscle sections as preparative artifacts, wesuggest that the following criteria be met before\\nconcluding that a thick filamentous structureisindeed composed of myosin:(a) The spacing of thin actin filaments shouldbe regular.(b) Order should be demonstrable in the ar-rangement of thick filaments, with respect both to\\neach other and to actin.(c) Magnification and resolution should be ade-quate to identify the substructure of the myosin\\naggregate, namely projections characteristic of\\nmyosin heads, bare central region,and distaltaper. In most previous studies of sectioned verte-brate smooth muscle, magnifications have been\\nused which are too low to visualize molecular di-\\nmensions and, indeed, often too low for accurate\\nmeasurement of filament width.(d) Technique should be adequate to resolvethe globular substructure of actin filaments,inorder to further exclude the possibility that thick\\nfilaments about 140 A in diameter are due to side-\\nto-side association of two actin filaments,or toformation of a compound actomyosin filament.(e) The diameter of presumed myosin filamentsin sectioned muscle should not exceed the maxi-\\nmum diameter of aggregates of smooth muscle\\nmyosin produced synthetically in vitro.Review of all published electron micrographsthat are thought to demonstrate thick filaments of\\nmyosin have failed to reveal any filaments which\\nmeet the above criteria. The thick filaments re-cently described by Kelly and Rice (6) are ran-\\ndomly distributed. Large areas of their sectionscontain no thick filaments, and some areas are de-void of all filaments (Figs. 8 and 12 of reference 6).Figs. 1, 2, and 4 of Nonomura (21) also demon-strate randomly arranged thick filaments of vari-able diameter, with minimum distances between\\nthick filaments of about 700 A. In cross-section,structures identified by Nonomura as thick fila-ments are resolvable into contiguous ovoid densities\\neach with dimensions characteristic of actin. Themean filament diameter for the primary peak in\\nNonomura\\'s bimodal frequencydistribution offilament diameters is consistent with actin dimen-sions, and the mean diameter for the small sec-ondary peak is about twice the primary one, again\\nsuggesting side-to-side apposition of actin.Actinshows strong electrical birefringence (23) and maybe held in its regular array in vivo by mutual re-pulsion provided by fixed charges along the fila-\\nments (12).Charge neutralization by preparativetechniques could account for loss of regular actin\\nfilament spacing andapposition of filaments.Kelly and Rice attribute the presence of thickfilaments in their sections to aggregation of myosin\\nduring prolonged storage of thespecimens inglycerin at pH 5.8-6.6(6).In our experience,however, glycerination at pH 6.2 for even Iwkresulted in disruption of normal ultrastructure in\\nthe superficial portions of the tissue blocks, and\\nmaterial so stored for 4 months showed loss of\\nultrastructure throughout the specimen. We canreadily find molecules of myosin in superficial por-\\ntions of specimens stored briefly at pH 6.2 and inthe relatively intact central portionsof blocksstored at pH 6.2 for up to I wk. Perhaps the blockswhich Kelly and Rice stored for 6 months were\\nsufficiently large to provide less damaged tissue in\\nthe depths of the specimen, but is is difficult to\\nknow what the pH might have been in these\\nusable portions.Shoenberg (20)has recently proposedthatmyosin exists in molecular form in resting smoothmuscle and reversibly aggregates into thick fila-ments when activation raises intracellular Ca++Though one cannot exclude the possibility of con-\\ntraction-coupled aggegation of myosin, itseemsextremely unlikely. The belief that smooth musclecells contract slowly enough to permit reversible\\naggregation of myosin is based on older data for\\ntetanic contractions inlarge cell populations\\n.When a single action potential in an individual\\nsmooth muscle cell is correlated with the tension\\ndeveloped by very small populations of cells, the\\ntime course of the twitch is comparable to that of a\\nslow skeletal muscle. For example, peak twitchtension in a 5 mm strip of taenia coli (24) and in a\\nstrip of fowl anterior mesenteric artery(25) isattained in about 500 msec. Time until onset ofcontraction should be even shorter, especially if it\\nwere possible to eliminate conduction time in the\\nstrips by correlating electrical and mechanical\\nevents for a single cell. Minimum time for aggre-gation of smooth muscle myosin in vitro is aboutI min(20).We conclude that smooth muscle con-traction is at least 100 times too fast to be ex-\\nplained by reversible, contraction-coupled aggre-gation of myosin. Direct evidence against the ideaof contraction-coupled aggregation is the fact thatliving vertebrate smooth muscle exhibits no change\\nin birefringence during isometric contraction(4).BERNARD PANNER AND CARL HONIGVertebrate Smooth Muscle Myosin59Downloaded from https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/44/1/52/447322/52.pdf by guest on 20 July 2020The birefringence data are consistent with evi-dence from X-ray diffraction in living and fixedsmooth muscles (3, 11) and with the electron\\nmicroscopic findings described in this paper.Whether apparent failure of smooth muscle myo-\\nsin to aggregate in vivo is a property of the indi-\\nvidual myosin molecules or of a controlling re-\\nactant, such as a recently described myosin\\naggregation factor(26),remains to be determined.Ultrastructure and Contraction MechanismThe existence of myosin in relatively unaggre-gated form (dimers or tetramers) is consistent with\\nthe contraction mechanism we have previouslysuggested(1).In our view, shortening is attribu-table to interdigitation and sliding of actin fila-ments of opposite sense. Motion is imparted bynumerous myosin dimers which form linkages be-tween actin filaments. Asynchronous making andbreaking of links along the entire free length of\\nactin outside the dense body allows for sustained\\ntension even though individual dimers become dis-\\nconnected during shortening. A similar mechanism\\n\\nmay underlie movement in slime molds (27) and\\nin other primitive motile systems in which acto-\\nmyosin-like proteins have been described (28, 29,\\n30).Two pieces of evidence crucial to proof of thishypothesis are still missing. Myosin dimers havenot been visualized in tissue sections of smoothmuscle, for reasons cited above, though they havebeen found in fresh homogenates(1).Secondly,REFERENCES1. PANNER, B. J., and C. R.

Thehypothesis is nevertheless consistent with all pres-ent biochemical and ultrastructural observations,and it accounts for the broad length optimum for\\ntension development so characteristic of smoothmuscle(5).In striated muscles maximum tensionis developed only over the small range of sarco-mere lengths within which actin and myosin sites\\noverlap to a maximum extent. This range is de-termined by the length of the bare central zone\\nof the A band filament(31).Smooth muscle, incontrast, subserves functions which require much\\nlarger per cent changes in length. In the moleculararrangement we propose, actin and myosin can\\ninteract over at least 2‡,or more than 10 timesthe length of the bare zone of the A band filament.We therefore regard maintenance of myosin in un-\\naggregated form as an adaptation which facilitates\\nshortening by increasing the range of lengths over\\nwhich tension-generating actomyosin linkages can\\nbe formed.We thank Dr. Clarence N.
