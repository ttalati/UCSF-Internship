In several types of tumor, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration have been reported to predict the response to immunotherapy, although each has its limitations. In the current study, we aimed to explore the association of TMB with immune infiltration and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma. Methods: The data of cutaneous melanoma used for analyses was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The mutation data was sorted using ""maftools"" R package. TMB was estimated and then patients were divided into two groups based on TMB. The association of TMB with prognosis and clinical characteristics was explored. Differential analysis between two TMB groups was performed using ""DESeq2"" R package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The function enrichment analyses of DEGs were conducted to screen critical pathways. Besides, DEGs were further filtered to identify two hub genes, based on which a risk score model and nomogram for predicting prognosis were conducted, and the validation was performed using three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Finally, CIBERSORT algorithm and TIMER database were used to assess the effect of TMB and hub genes on immune infiltration. Results: The most common mutation was C > T, and the top three frequently mutated genes were TTN, MUC16, and BRAF. Higher TMB indicated better survival outcomes and lower pathological stages. 735 DEGs were identified and mainly involved in immune-related and adhesion-related pathways. The risk score model and nomogram were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves, and exhibited relatively high predictive capability. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit. As for immune infiltration, the proportion was higher for macrophages M1 and M2 in the high-TMB group, while lower for memory B cells and regulatory T cells. Conclusions: In cutaneous melanoma, TMB was positively correlated with prognosis. The risk score model and nomogram can be conveniently used to predict prognosis. The association of TMB with immune infiltration can help improve the predicting methods for the response to immunotherapy.",

The aim of this research study was to identify differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) and establish a Cox prediction model for the evaluation of prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Transcription expression data, immune gene data, and tumor transcription factor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal, and the Cistrome Cancer database were analyzed to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEIRGs, and differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to obtain potential DEIRGs as independent prognostic factors. Oncomine, The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), TIMER databases were performed to validate the mRNA and protein expression level of DEIRGs. TIMER database was performed to explore the immunocytes infiltration of DEIRGs. In total, 7448 DEGs, 536 DEIRGs, 87 DETFs were identified from 1,037 NSCLC tissues and 108 normal tissues in TCGA database. Fifteen-DEIRG signatures (THBS1, S100P, S100A16, DLL4, CD70, DKK1, IL33, NRTN, PDGFB, STC2, VGF, GCGR, HTR3A, LGR4, SHC3) could be perceived as independent prognostic factors for predicting the overall survival of patients with NSCLC (P = 4.89e--09). Immune cell correlation analysis showed that neutrophils and b cells were positively and negatively correlated with the riskscore of the prediction model, respectively. Our study identified a Cox prediction model based on DEIRGs to predict the overall survival of patients with NSCLC.

This research aimed to discover the differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) based on the Cox predictive model to predict survival for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) through bioinformatics analysis. First of all, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the limma R package, the DEIRGs were obtained from the ImmPort database, whereas the differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) were acquired from the Cistrome database. Thereafter, a TFs-mediated IRGs network was constructed to identify the candidate mechanisms for those DEIRGs in LUSC at molecular level. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO), together with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, was conducted for exploring those functional enrichments for DEIRGs. Besides, univariate as well as multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted for establishing a prediction model for DEIRGs biomarkers. In addition, the relationship between the prognostic model and immunocytes was further explored through immunocyte correlation analysis. In total, 3,599 DEGs, 223 DEIRGs, and 46 DETFs were obtained from LUSC tissues and adjacent non-carcinoma tissues. According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, 10 DEIRGs (including CALCB, GCGR, HTR3A, AMH, VGF, SEMA3B, NRTN, ENG, ACVRL1, and NR4A1) were retrieved to establish a prognostic model for LUSC. Immunocyte infiltration analysis showed that dendritic cells and neutrophils were positively correlated with IRGs, which possibly exerted an important part within the IME of LUSC. Our study identifies a prognostic model based on IRGs, which is then used to predict LUSC prognosis and analyze immunocyte infiltration. This may provide a novel insight for exploring the potential IRGs in the IME of LUSC.",

However, there is no reliable molecular marker that can effectively estimate the immune infiltration and predict the CC relapse risk. Here, we leveraged the gene expression profile and clinical characteristics from 1430 samples, including four gene expression omnibus database (GEO) databases and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, to construct an immune risk signature that could be used as a predictor of survival outcome and immune activity. A risk model consisting of 10 immune-related genes were screened out in the Lasso-Cox model and were then aggregated to generate the immune risk signature based on the regression coefficients. The signature demonstrated robust prognostic ability in discovery and validation datasets, and this association remained significant in the multivariate analysis after controlling for age, gender, clinical stage, or microsatellite instability status. Leukocyte subpopulation analysis indicated that the low-risk signature was enriched with cytotoxic cells (activated CD4/CD8+ T cell and NK cell) and depleted of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells. Further analysis indicated patients with a low-risk signature harbored higher tumor mutation loads and lower mutational frequencies in significantly mutated genes of APC and FBXW7. Together, our constructed signature could predict prognosis and represent the TIM of CC, which promotes individualized treatment and provides a promising novel molecular marker for immunotherapy.",

Immunotherapy has become an effective treatment in recent years, while patients showed different responses to the current treatment. It is vital to identify the potential immunogenomic signatures to predict patient' prognosis. The expression profiles of LSCC patients with the clinical information were downloaded from TCGA database. Differentially expressed immune-related genes (IRGs) were extracted using edgeR algorithm, and functional enrichment analysis showed that these IRGs were primarily enriched in inflammatory- and immune-related processes. ""Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" and ""PI3K-AKT signaling pathway"" were the most enriched KEGG pathways. 27 differentially expressed IRGs were significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of patients using univariate Cox regression analysis. A prognostic risk signature that comprises seven IRGs (GCCR, FGF8, CLEC4M, PTH, SLC10A2, NPPC, and FGF4) was developed with effective predictive performance by multivariable Cox stepwise regression analysis. Most importantly, the signature could be an independent prognostic predictor after adjusting for clinicopathological parameters, and also validated in two independent LSCC cohorts (GSE4573 and GSE17710). Potential molecular mechanisms and tumor immune landscape of these IRGs were investigated through computational biology. Analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and immune checkpoint molecules revealed distinct immune landscape in high- and low-risk group. The study was the first time to construct IRG-based immune signature in the recognition of disease progression and prognosis of LSCC patients.",
6,"Wenliang Yuan, Wei Cai, Xiao Huang, Sihua Peng",Prognostic value of immune scores in the microenvironment of colorectal cancer.,,20,,PMID: 32994819,"Cancer immunotherapy has become an important means of cancer treatment; however, the complex composition and heterogeneity of the colorectal cancer (CRC) microenvironment pose a huge challenge to cancer immunotherapy. Using data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the differences in the microenvironment between cases with low and high immune scores were examined at the multiomics level using bioinformatics approaches. It was revealed that the samples with high immune scores had good cytolytic immune responses and relatively abundant stromal cells, as well as significant infiltration of 22 immune cell subsets and a high non-synonymous mutation burden and neoantigen burden. All of these characteristics contribute to a good prognosis. To better understand the impact of immune-related genes on prognosis, differentially expressed genes between the low and high immune score samples were identified and it was concluded that serpin family Emember 1 (SERPINE1) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) may be potential therapeutic targets. The relationship between the immune score and the infiltration of 22 immune cells and the difference in SERPINE1 expression were verified by analyzing the GSE17536 and GSE21510 data sets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The present study analyzed the unique properties of immune cells in the CRC microenvironment, which are of great significance for understanding CRC immune mechanism and may also provide novel ideas for the targeted design of cancer immunotherapy.",

Immune-related genes and immune infiltrating lymphocytes are involved in tumor growth, and in the past decade, immunotherapy has become increasingly important in the treatment of lung cancer. Using the edgeR package, differentially expressed genes and immune-related genes (DEIRGs) were identified in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Functional enrichment analysis of DEIRGs was performed using Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Survival-associated immune-related genes (IRGs) were selected using univariate Cox regression analysis and the prognostic model was assessed using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Overall, 273 DEIRGs were identified in LUAD, and KEGG pathway analysis of IRGs showed that 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' was the most significantly enriched pathway. Furthermore, six survival associated IRGs were screened to establish a prognostic model; patients in the high risk score group had less favorable survival times, and the prognostic model was negatively associated with B cell infiltration. The present study established a prognostic model using analysis of survival-related immune-related genes, which were associated with B cell infiltration.",

Reliable markers associated with the immune response are not available to predict the prognosis of patients with ccRCC. We exploited the extensive number of ccRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository to perform a comprehensive analysis of immune-related genes (IRGs). Methods: Based on TCGA data, we incorporated IRGs and their expression profiles of 72 normal and 539 ccRCC samples. Univariate Cox analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between overall survival (OS) and IRGs expression. The Lasso Cox regression model identified prognostic genes used to establish a clinical immune prognostic model. The TF-IRG network was used to study the potential molecular mechanisms of action and properties of ccRCC-specific IRGs. Multivariate Cox analysis established a clinical prognostic model of IRGs. Results: We found a significant correlation among 15 differentially expressed IRGs with the OS of patients with ccRCC. Gene function enrichment analysis showed that these IRGs are significantly associated with response to receptor ligand activity. Lasso Cox regression analysis identified 10 genes with the greatest prognostic value. A clinical prognostic model based on six IRGs, which performed well for predicting prognosis, revealed significant associations of patients' survival with age, sex, stage, tumor, node, and metastasis. Moreover, these findings reflect the infiltration of tumors by various immune cells. Conclusion: We identified six clinically significant IRGs and incorporated them into a clinical prognostic model with great significance for monitoring and predicting prognosis of ccRCC.",

In this study, we aimed to explore the prognostic value of TMB and the potential association between TMB and immune infiltration in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). Somatic mutation and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. TMB was calculated and patients were divided into high- and low-TMB groups. After performing differential analysis between high- and low-risk groups, we identified six hub TMB and immune-related genes that were correlated with overall survival in LGGs. Then, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to screen significantly enriched GO terms between the two groups. Moreover, an immune-related risk score system was developed by LASSO Cox analysis based on the six hub genes and was validated with the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas dataset. Using the TIMER database, we further systematically analyzed the relationships between mutants of the six hub genes and immune infiltration levels, as well as the relationships between the immune-related risk score system and the immune microenvironment in LGGs. The results showed that TMB was negatively correlated with OS and high TMB might inhibit immune infiltration in LGGs. Furthermore, the risk score system could effectively stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups in both the training and validation datasets. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that TMB was not an independent prognostic factor, but the risk score was. Higher infiltration of immune cells (B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) and higher levels of immune checkpoints (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3) were found in patients in the high-risk group. Finally, a novel nomogram model was constructed and evaluated to estimate the overall survival of LGG patients. In summary, our study provided new insights into immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapies for LGGs.",

The immune response is implicated in chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Here, we reported an immune risk (Imm-R) model for prognostic prediction in patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Gene expression profiles and corresponding clinical information were collected from four data sets and divided into training set (n = 183) and validation set (validation set1: n = 34; validation set2: n = 99). The composition of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) populations was characterized with the CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm. A prognostic Imm-R model for predicting overall survival was established by performing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized COX regression analysis. T follicular helper cells and M0 macrophages were associated with better survival, while eosinophils were associated with worse survival. TIICs signature was constructed based on the above three immune cell types. Furthermore, a Imm-R model was created by integrating TIICs signature with immune-related genes (IRGs), which effectively in distinguishing CRC patients with poorer prognosis.

Then, immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden (TMB) landscapes associated with this signature in melanoma were analyzed comprehensively. With the 10-IRG prognostic signature, melanoma patients in the low-risk group showed better survival with distinct features of high immune cell infiltration and TMB. Importantly, melanoma patients in this subgroup were significantly responsive to MAGE-A3 in the validation cohort. This immune-related prognostic signature is thus a reliable tool to predict melanoma prognosis; as the underlying mechanism of this signature is associated with immune infiltration and mutation burden, it might reflect the benefit of immunotherapy to patients.",

In recent years, immunotherapy for tumors has been widely studied, but a practical prognostic model based on immune-related genes (IRGs) in EC has not been established and reported. This study aimed to develop an immunogenomic risk score for predicting survival outcomes among EC patients. In this study, we downloaded the transcriptome profiling data and matched clinical data of EC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found 4,094 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EC and normal esophageal tissue (p < 0.05 and fold change >2). Then, the intersection of DEGs and the immune genes in the ""ImmPort"" database resulted in 303 differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs). Next, through univariate Cox regression analysis of DEIRGs, we obtained 17 immune genes related to prognosis. We detected nine optimal survival-associated IRGs (HSPA6, CACYBP, DKK1, EGF, FGF19, GAST, OSM, ANGPTL3, NR2F2) by using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, we used those survival-associated IRGs to construct a risk model to predict the prognosis of EC patients. This model could accurately predict overall survival in EC and could be used as a classifier for the evaluation of low-risk and high-risk groups. In conclusion, we identified a practical and robust nine-gene prognostic model based on immune gene dataset. These genes may provide valuable biomarkers and prognostic predictors for EC patients and could be further studied to help understand the mechanism of EC occurrence and development.",

The aim of this study is to leverage a new seed-inference algorithm demonstrated for Alzheimer's disease to the Parkinsonian context and to cluster patients in meaningful subgroups based on these incipient atrophy patterns. Instead of testing brain regions separately as the likely initiation site for each patient, we solve an L1-penalized optimization problem that can return a more predictive heterogeneous, multi-locus seed patterns. A cluster analysis of the individual seed patterns reveals two distinct subgroups (S1 versus S2). The S1 subgroup is characterized by the involvement of the brainstem and ventral nuclei, and S2 by cortex and striatum. Post hoc analysis in features not included in the clustering shows significant differences between subgroups regarding age of onset and local transcriptional patterns of Parkinson-related genes. Top genes associated with regional microglial abundance are strongly associated with subgroup S1 but not with S2. Our results suggest two distinct aetiological mechanisms operative in Parkinson disease. The interplay between immune-related genes, lysosomal genes, microglial abundance and atrophy initiation sites may explain why the age of onset for patients in S1 is on average 4.5 years later than for those in S2. We highlight and compare the most prominently affected brain regions for both subgroups. Altogether, our findings may improve current screening strategies for early Parkinson onsetters.",

Changes in molecular pathways can be detected using high-throughput omics datasets (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) by using methods such as pathway enrichment, network analysis, machine learning, etc. Importantly, integration of multiple omic datasets is becoming key to revealing novel biological insights. In this perspective article, we highlight the use of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks as a multi-omics integration approach to unravel information flow and mechanisms during complex biological events, with a focus on the immune system. This involves a combination of tools, including: InnateDB, a database of curated interactions between genes and protein products involved in the innate immunity; NetworkAnalyst, a visualization and analysis platform for InnateDB interactions; and MetaBridge, a tool to integrate metabolite data into PPI networks. The application of these systems techniques is demonstrated for a variety of biological questions, including: the developmental trajectory of neonates during the first week of life, mechanisms in host-pathogen interaction, disease prognosis, biomarker discovery, and drug discovery and repurposing.

Existing approaches in interpreting and using cytometry measurements include manual or automated gating to identify cell subsets from the cytometry data, providing highly intuitive results but may lead to significant information loss, in that additional details in measured or correlated cell signals might be missed. In this study, we propose and test a deep convolutional neural network for analyzing cytometry data in an end-to-end fashion, allowing a direct association between raw cytometry data and the clinical outcome of interest. Using nine large cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry or mass cytometry (CyTOF) studies from the open-access ImmPort database, we demonstrated that the deep convolutional neural network model can accurately diagnose the latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in healthy individuals, even when using highly heterogeneous data from different studies. In addition, we developed a permutation-based method for interpreting the deep convolutional neural network model. We were able to identify a CD27- CD94+ CD8+ T cell population significantly associated with latent CMV infection, confirming the findings in previous studies. Finally, we provide a tutorial for creating, training, and interpreting the tailored deep learning model for cytometry data using Keras and TensorFlow (https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF).",

Moreover, correlation analysis of immunocyte infiltration also revealed that the seven-IRG prognostic model was positively associated with five types of immunocytes (dendritic cell, macrophage, CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and neutrophil), which may directly reflect tumor immune state in COAD. Conclusions: Our present findings indicate that the prognostic model based on prognosis-related IRGs plays a crucial role in the clinical supervision and prognostic prediction of COAD patients at both molecular and cellular levels.",

Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles and clinical data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genes that were differentially expressed between breast tumor tissues and normal breast tissues. Comparisons with the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) indicated that many of the identified differentially expressed genes were immune-related. Risk scores calculated based on an eight-gene signature constructed from these immune-related genes predicted both overall survival and relapse-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. The predictive value of the eight-gene signature was validated in different breast cancer subtypes using external datasets. Associations between risk score and breast cancer immune characteristics were also identified; invitro experiments using breast cancer cell lines confirmed those associations. Thus, the novel eight-gene signature described here accurately predicts breast cancer survival outcomes as well as immune checkpoint expression and immune cell infiltration processes.",

We observed that 17 differentially expressed IRGs were significantly associated with survival in LIHC patients. These LIHC-specific IRGs were validated with function analysis and molecular characteristics. Cox analysis was applied for constructing a RiskScore for predicting the survival. The RiskScore involved six IRGs and corresponding coefficients, which was calculated with the following formula: RiskScore = [Expression level of FABP5 *(0.064)] + [Expression level of TRAF3 * (0.198)] + [Expression level of CSPG5 * (0.416)] + [Expression level of IL17D * (0.197)] + [Expression level of STC2 * (0.036)] + [Expression level of BRD8 * (0.140)]. The RiskScore was positively associated with the poor survival, which was verified with the dataset from ICGC database.

The involvement of cerumen in immune defense is poorly understood. MicroRNAs can modulate the host immune response and can provide promising biomarkers for several inflammatory and infectious disorder diagnosis. The aims of this study were to profile the cerumen miRNA signature associated with otitis externa in dogs, integrate miRNAs to their target genes related to immune functions, and investigate their potential use as biomarkers. Cerumen was collected from healthy and otitis affected dogs and the expression of miRNAs was profiled by Next Generation Sequencing; the validation of the altered miRNAs was performed using RT-qPCR. The potential ability of miRNAs to modulate immune-related genes was investigated using bioinformatics tools. The results pointed out that 32 miRNAs, of which 14 were up- and 18 down-regulated, were differentially expressed in healthy vs. otitis-affected dogs. These results were verified by RT-qPCR. To assess the diagnostic value of miRNAs, ROC analysis was carried out, highlighting that 4 miRNAs are potential biomarkers to discriminate otitis-affected dogs. Bioinformatics showed that cerumen miRNAs may be involved in the modulation of host immune response. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs can be efficiently extracted and quantified from cerumen, that their profile changes between healthy and otitis affected dogs, and that they may serve as potential biomarkers.

Univariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify 26 IRGs that were associated with survival. A Cox proportional hazards model with a lasso penalty identified five optimal IRGs for constructing the immunogenomic risk score (CD1B, XCL1, PLCG2, NGF, and OXTR). The risk score had good performance in predicting overall survival among patients with colon cancer and was correlated with the amount of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

It is based on statistical analysis of pharmacovigilance reports and subsequent signaling pathway analyses, followed by evidence-based expert manual curation of the outcomes. Our analysis: (a) ranked pharmaceuticals with high occurrence of such adverse events (AEs), based on disproportionality analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and (b) identified 120 associated genes and common pathway nodes possibly underlying MCAEs. Nearly two-thirds of the identified genes were related to immune modulation, which supports the critical involvement of immune cells and their responses in the regulation of the central nervous system function. This finding also means that pharmaceuticals with a negligible central nervous system exposure may induce MCAEs through dysregulation of the peripheral immune system. Knowledge gained through this workflow unravels putative hallmark biological targets and mediators of drug-induced mood and cognitive disorders that need to be further assessed and validated in experimental models.

In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated.

Young children, elderly, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women are at higher risk for being infected by the influenza virus. Our study aims to highlight differentially expressed genes in influenza disease compared to influenza vaccination, including variability due to age and sex. To accomplish our goals, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data. Our inclusion criteria included subjects with influenza, subjects who received the influenza vaccine and healthy controls. We curated 18 microarray datasets for a total of 3,481 samples (1,277 controls, 297 influenza infection, 1,907 influenza vaccination). We pre-processed the raw microarray expression data in R using packages available to pre-process Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms. We used a Box-Cox power transformation of the data prior to our down-stream analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. Statistical analyses were based on linear mixed effects model with all study factors and successive likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to identify differentially-expressed genes. We filtered LRT results by disease (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) and used a two-tailed 10% quantile cutoff to identify biologically significant genes. Furthermore, we assessed age and sex effects on the disease genes by filtering for genes with a statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) interaction between disease and age, and disease and sex. We identified 4,889 statistically significant genes when we filtered the LRT results by disease factor, and gene enrichment analysis (gene ontology and pathways) included innate immune response, viral process, defense response to virus, Hematopoietic cell lineage and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our quantile filtered gene lists comprised of 978 genes each associated with influenza infection and vaccination. We also identified 907 and 48 genes with statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) disease-age and disease-sex interactions, respectively.

The PCH generates a series of expectations that can be tested empirically and that may help to identify the mechanisms underlying sex differences in modern human diseases.",DOI 10.1016/j.tig.2019.04.008.

Growing evidence suggests respiratory viral infections are often more severe in CF compared to healthy peers and contributes to pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and deterioration of lung function. Rhinovirus is the most prevalent respiratory virus detected, particularly during exacerbations in children with CF <5 years old. However, even though rhinoviral infections are likely to be one of the factors initiating the onset of CF lung disease, there is no effective targeted treatment. A better understanding of the innate immune responses by CF airway epithelial cells, the primary site of infection for viruses, is needed to identify why viral infections are more severe in CF. The aim of this review is to present the clinical impact of virus infection in both young children and adults with CF, focusing on rhinovirus infection. Previous in vitro and in vivo investigations looking at the mechanisms behind virus infection will also be summarized. The review will finish on the potential of transcriptomics to elucidate the host-pathogen responses by CF airway cells to viral infection and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

There are few predictive biomarkers of response, and the tumor immune microenvironment associated with progression and prognosis remains unclear in STS. Gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas were used to identify the immune-related prognostic genes (IRPGs) and construct the immune gene-related prognostic model (IGRPM). The tumor immune microenvironment was characterized to reveal differences between patients with different prognoses. Furthermore, somatic mutation data and DNA methylation data were analyzed to understand the underlying mechanism leading to different prognoses. The IGRPM was constructed using five IRPGs (IFIH1, CTSG, STC2, SECTM1, and BIRC5). Two groups (high- and low-risk patients) were identified based on the risk score. Low-risk patients with higher overall survival time had higher immune scores, more immune cell infiltration (e.g., CD8 T cell and activated natural killer cells), higher expression of immune-stimulating molecules, higher stimulating cytokines and corresponding receptors, higher innate immunity molecules, and stronger antigen-presenting capacity. However, inhibition of immunity was observed in low-risk patients owing to the higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules and inhibiting cytokines. High-risk patients had high tumor mutation burden, which did not significantly influence survival. Gene set enrichment analysis further revealed that pathways of cell cycle and cancers were activated in high-risk patients. DNA methylation analysis indicated that relative high methylation was associated with better overall survival. Finally, the age, mitotic counts, and risk scores were independent prognostic factors for STS. Five IRPGs performed well in risk stratification of patients and are candidate biomarkers for predicting response to immunotherapy. Differences observed through the multi-omic study of patients with different prognoses may reveal the underlying mechanism of the development and progression of STS, and thereby improve treatment.",

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the TME and gene expression profiles to identify prognostic biomarkers for BC. The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate immune and stromal scores of BC patients who were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We found that the immune and stromal scores were associated with clinical characteristics and the prognosis of BC patients. Based on these scores, 104 immune-related differentially expressed genes were identified. Further, functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in the immune-related biological processes and signaling pathways. Three prognostic genes were then identified and used to establish a risk prediction model using Cox regression analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the expression levels of COL1A1, COMP, and SERPINE2 significantly correlated with cancer-specific survival and overall survival of BC patients. Additionally, we validated the prognostic values of these genes using two independent cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Finally, the relationships between the three prognostic genes and several immune cells were evaluated using Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, indicating that the expression levels of COL1A1, COMP, and SERPINE2 correlated positively with the tumor infiltration levels of CD4+ T cells and macrophages.

Even though some patients can be treated with surgery plus chemoradiotherapy as a conventional option, the overall efficacy is deemed unsatisfactory. As such, the development for new treatment approaches is truly necessary. In recent years, immunotherapy has been widely used in clinical practice and it is an area of great interest that researchers are keeping attention on. However, a thorough immune-related genes (IRGs) study for cervical cancer and endometrial cancer is still lacking. We therefore aim to make a comprehensive evaluation of IRGs through bioinformatics and large databases, and also investigate the relationship between the two types of cancer. We reviewed the transcriptome RNAs of IRGs and clinical data based on the TCGA database. Survival-associated IRGs in cervical/endometrial cancer were identified using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis for developing an IRG signature model to evaluate the risk of patients. In the end, this model was validated based on the enrichment analyses through GO, KEGG, and GSEA pathways, Kaplan-Meier survival curve, ROC curves, and immune cell infiltration. Our results showed that out of 25/23 survival-associated IRGs for cervical/endometrial cancer, 13/12 warranted further examination by multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis and were selected to develop an IRGs signature model. As a result, enrichment analyses for high-risk groups indicated main enriched pathways were associated with tumor development and progression, and statistical differences were found between high-risk and low-risk groups as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival curve. This model could be used as an independent measure for risk assessment and was considered relevant to immune cell infiltration, but it had nothing to do with clinicopathological characteristics. In summary, based on comprehensive analysis, we obtained the IRGs signature model in cervical cancer (LTA, TFRC, TYK2, DLL4, CSK, JUND, NFATC4, SBDS, FLT1, IL17RD, IL3RA, SDC1, PLAU) and endometrial cancer (LTA, PSMC4, KAL1, TNF, SBDS, HDGF, LTB, HTR3E, NR2F1, NR3C1, PGR, CBLC), which can effectively evaluate the prognosis and risk of patients and provide justification in immunology for further researches.",

Therefore, immune-related genes (IRGs) expression may be an important predictor of LUSC prognosis. However, a prognostic model based on IRGs that can systematically assess the prognosis of LUSC patients is still lacking. This study aimed to construct a LUSC immune-related prognostic model by using IRGs. Methods: Gene expression data about LUSC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differential expression analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify prognostic differentially expressed IRGs. A prognostic model was constructed using the Lasso and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then we validated the performance of the prognostic model in training and test cohorts. Furthermore, associations with clinical variables and immune infiltration were also analyzed. Results: 593 differentially expressed IRGs were identified, and 8 of them were related to prognosis. Then a transcription factor regulatory network was established. A prognostic model consisted of 4 immune-related genes was constructed by using Lasso and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The prognostic value of this model was successfully validated in training and test cohorts. Further analysis showed that the prognostic model could be used independently to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. The relationships between the risk score and immune cell infiltration indicated that the model could reflect the status of the tumor immune microenvironment. Conclusions: We constructed a risk model using four PDIRGs that can accurately predict the prognosis of LUSC patients.

Screening programs and new therapies have only marginally improved the survival of CRC patients. Immune-related genes (IRGs) have attracted attention in recent years as therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to identify an immune-related prognostic signature for CRC. To this end, we combined gene expression and clinical data from the CRC data sets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into an integrated immune landscape profile. We identified a total of 476 IRGs that were differentially expressed in CRC vs normal tissues, of which 18 were survival related according to univariate Cox analysis. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis established an immune-related prognostic signature consisting of SLC10A2, FGF2, CCL28, NDRG1, ESM1, UCN, UTS2 and TRDC. The predictive ability of this signature for 3- and 5-year overall survival was determined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and the respective areas under the curve (AUC) were 79.2% and 76.6%. The signature showed moderate predictive accuracy in the validation and GSE38832 data sets as well. Furthermore, the 8-IRG signature correlated significantly with tumour stage, invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis by univariate Cox analysis, and was established an independent prognostic factor by multivariate Cox regression analysis for CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a relationship between the IRG prognostic signature and various biological pathways. Focal adhesions and ECM-receptor interactions were positively correlated with the risk scores, while cytosolic DNA sensing and metabolism-related pathways were negatively correlated. Finally, the bioinformatics results were validated by real-time RT-qPCR. In conclusion, we identified and validated a novel, immune-related prognostic signature for patients with CRC, and this signature reflects the dysregulated tumour immune microenvironment and has a potential for better CRC patient management.",

Therefore, we aimed to develop an immune-relevant-gene-based signature to predict LUAD patients' prognosis and to characterize their tumor microenvironment thus guiding therapeutic strategy. Methods and Materials: Gene expression data of LUAD patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were systematically analyzed. We performed Cox regression and random survival forest algorithm to identify immune-relevant genes with potential prognostic value. A risk score formula was then established by integrating these selected genes and patients were classified into high- and low-risk score group.

We also found the distinct immune infiltration patterns in the two groups that several immune cells like cytotoxic cells and immune checkpoint molecules were significantly enriched and upregulated in patients from the high-risk group. These findings were further validated in two independent LUAD cohorts.

The available literature on blood transcriptome in ASD suggests that through accurate experimental design it is possible to extract important information on the disease pathophysiology at the peripheral level. Here we exploit the availability of a resource for molecular biomarkers in ASD, the Italian Autism Network (ITAN) collection, for the investigation of transcriptomic signatures in ASD based on a discordant sibling pair design. Whole blood samples from 75 discordant sibling pairs selected from the ITAN network where submitted to RNASeq analysis and data analyzed by complementary approaches. Overall, differences in gene expression between affected and unaffected siblings were small. In order to assess the contribution of differences in the relative proportion of blood cells between discordant siblings, we have applied two different cell deconvolution algorithms, showing that the observed molecular signatures mainly reflect changes in peripheral blood immune cell composition, in particular NK cells. The results obtained by the cell deconvolution approach are supported by the analysis performed by WGCNA. Our report describes the largest differential gene expression profiling in peripheral blood of ASD subjects and controls conducted by RNASeq. The observed signatures are consistent with the hypothesis of immune alterations in autism and an increased risk of developing autism in subjects exposed to prenatal infections or stress.

We found that differentially expressed immune genes were closely associated with patient prognosis in HNSCC by comparing the differences in gene expression between cancer and normal samples and performing survival analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to annotate the biological functions of the differentially expressed immunogenomic prognosis-related genes. Two additional cohorts from the Oncomine database were used for validation. 65, 56 differentially expressed IRGs was associated with clinical prognosis in total and HPV- samples, respectively. Furthermore, we extracted 10, 11 prognosis-related IRGs from 65, 56 differentially expressed IRGs, respectively. They were significantly correlated with clinical prognosis and used to construct the prognosis prediction models. The multivariable ROC curves (specifically, the AUC) were used to measure the accuracy of the prognostic models. These genes were mainly enriched in several gene ontology (GO) terms related to immunocyte migration and receptor and ligand activity. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, which are primarily involved in biological processes. In addition, we identified 63 differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) from 4784 differentially expressed genes, and 16 edges involving 18 nodes were formed in the regulatory network between differentially expressed TFs and the high-risk survival-associated IRGs.

In this study, the expression profiles of immune-related genes (IRGs) were integrated with the overall survival (OS) of 378 LIHC patients based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Moreover, the differentially expressed and survival related IRGs among LIHC patients were predicted through the computational difference algorithm and COX regression analysis. As a result, 7 genes, including HSPA4, S100A10, FABP6, CACYBP, HDAC1, FCGR2B and SHC1, were retrieved to construct a predictive model associated with the overall survival (OS) of LIHC patients. Typically, the as-constructed model performed moderately in predicting prognosis, which was also correlated with tumor grade. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the genes of high-risk group were actively involved in mRNA binding and the spliceosome pathway. Intriguingly, the prognostic index established based on IRGs reflected infiltration by multiple types of immunocytes. Our findings screen several IRGs with clinical significance, reveal the drivers of immune repertoire, and illustrate the importance of a personalized, IRG-based immune signature in LIHC recognition, surveillance, and prognosis prediction.",

Immune-related genes (IRGs) and immune infiltrating lymphocytes play specific roles in tumor growth. Considering how important immunotherapy has become for HCC treatment in the past decade, our objective was to establish a prognostic model by screening survival-related IRGs in patients with HCC. Using edgeR, we identified differentially expressed IRGs (DEIRGs), DEmiRNAs, and DElncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of DEIRGs was performed to investigate the biological functions of IRGs via gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Protein-protein interaction and competing endogenous RNA networks were established using Cytoscape. Survival-associated IRGs were selected via univariate COX regression analysis, a The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prognostic model and GSE76427 validation model were developed using multivariate COX regression analysis test by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). We identified 116 DEIRGs in patients with HCC; the ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" pathway was found to be the most enriched pathway. Via the prognostic model helped us classify patients into high- and low-risk score groups based on overall survival (OS); high risk score was associated with worse OS, and a positive correlation was observed between the prognostic model and immune cell infiltration. To summarize, we established a prognostic model using survival-related IRGs that provides sufficient information for prognosis prediction and immunotherapy of patients with HCC.",

Moreover, the immune-related lncRNAs are likely to show expression perturbation in cancer and are significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration. ImmLnc can help prioritize cancer-related lncRNAs and further identify three molecular subtypes (proliferative, intermediate, and immunological) of non-small cell lung cancer. These subtypes are characterized by differences in mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, expression of immunomodulatory genes, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. In summary, the ImmLnc pipeline and the resulting data serve as a valuable resource for understanding lncRNA function and to advance identification of immunotherapy targets.",

Immune-associated genes between these groups were compared, and an optimal immune-related risk model was built by Cox regression analyses. The deconvolution algorithm (referred to as CIBERSORT) was applied to assess 22 TIICs for their amounts in the osteosarcoma microenvironment.

Here, we systematically identified DMTD by integrative analysis of transcriptome, methylome and regulatome across 22 human cancer types. Our results revealed that transcriptional regulation was affected by DNA methylation, involving hundreds of methylation-sensitive TFs (MethTFs). In addition, pan-cancer MethTFs, the regulatory activity of which is generally affected by DNA methylation across cancers, exhibit dominant functional characteristics and regulate several cancer hallmarks. Moreover, pan-cancer MethTFs were found to be affected by DNA methylation in a complex pattern. Finally, we investigated the cooperation among MethTFs and identified a network module that consisted of 43 MethTFs with prognostic potential. In summary, we systematically dissected the transcriptional dysregulation mediated by DNA methylation across cancer types, and our results provide a valuable resource for both epigenetic and transcriptional regulation communities.",

We aimed to explore the influence of the IDH1 mutation on the immune microenvironment and develop an IDH1-associated immune prognostic signature (IPS) for predicting prognosis in LGGs. IDH1 mutation status and RNA expression were investigated in two different public cohorts. To develop an IPS, LASSO Cox analysis was conducted for immune-related genes that were differentially expressed between IDH1wt and IDH1mut LGG patients. Then, we systematically analyzed the influence of the IPS on the immune microenvironment. A total of 41 immune prognostic genes were identified based on the IDH1 mutation status. A four-gene IPS was established and LGG patients were effectively stratified into low- and high-risk groups in both the training and validation sets. Stratification analysis and multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the IPS was an independent prognostic factor. We also found that high-risk LGG patients had higher levels of infiltrating B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, and expressed higher levels of CTLA-4, PD-1 and TIM-3. Moreover, a novel nomogram model was established to estimate the overall survival in LGG patients. The current study provides novel insights into the LGG immune microenvironment and potential immunotherapies. The proposed IPS is a clinically promising biomarker that can be used to classify LGG patients into subgroups with distinct outcomes and immunophenotypes, with the potential to facilitate individualized management and improve prognosis.",

Limited studies have investigated whether immune-related genes (IRGs) or tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) could be indicators for CC prognoses. The aim of this study was to develop an improved prognostic signature for CC based on IRGs or TIME to predict survival and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). A prognostic signature was constructed using bioinformatics method and its predictive capability was validated. The mechanisms underlying the signature's predictive capability were explored with CIBERSORT algorithm and mutation analysis. Immunophenoscore (IPS) is validated for ICIs response, and was therefore explored in relation to the signature. A prognostic signature based on 11 IRGs was developed. A multivariate analysis revealed that the 11-IRG signature was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free interval in CC patients. In the 11-IRG signature high-risk group, CD8 T cells and resting mast cells, which are found to associate with better OS in our study, were lower; activated mast cells, associated with poorer OS, were higher, compared with the low-risk group. An IPS analysis suggested that the 11-IRG signature low-risk group, which possessed a higher IPS, represented a more immunogenic phenotype that was more inclined to respond to ICIs. In short, an 11-IRG prognostic signature for predicting CC patients' survival and response to ICIs was firmly established. The predictive capability of this model in CC requires further testing with the goal of better prognostic stratification and treatment management.",

Increasing pieces of evidence revealed an association between immune signature and CRC prognosis. Thus, we aim to build a robust immune-related gene pairs (IRGPs) signature that can estimate prognosis for CRC. Gene expression profiles and clinical information of CRC patients were collected from six public cohorts, divided into training cohort (n = 565) and five independent validation cohorts (n = 572, 290, 90 177 and 68, respectively). Within 1534 immune genes, a 19 IRGPs signature consisting of 36 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with the survival. In the validation cohorts, the IRGPs signature significantly stratified patients into high- vs low-risk groups in terms of prognosis across and within subpopulations with early stages disease and was prognostic in univariate and multivariate analyses. Several biological processes, including response to bacterium, were enriched among genes in the IRGPs signature. Macrophage M2 and mast cells were significantly higher in the high-risk risk group compared with the low-risk group. The IRGPs signature achieved a higher accuracy than commercialized multigene signatures for estimation of survival. When integrated with clinical factors such as sex and stage, the composite clinical and IRGPs signature showed improved prognostic accuracy relative to IRGPs signatures alone. In short, we developed a robust IRGPs signature for estimating prognosis in CRC, including early-stage disease, providing new insights into the identification of CRC patients with a high risk of mortality.",

Not all patients could benefit from chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy due to tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, identifying different subgroups of patients is an important trend for obtaining more effective responses. However, few molecular classifications associated with chemosensitivity are based on immune-risk status. In this study, we obtained six key immune-related genes. Using these genes, we constructed a molecular model related to immune-risk status and calculated an individual immune-risk score. The score showed great efficiency and stability in predicting prognosis and identifying different subgroups where persons could benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapy. The patients could be divided into different risk groups based on the immune-related score. For patients in the low-risk group, both postoperative chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy could significantly improve prognosis on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (DFS, P < 0.001 and P = 0.041, respectively; OS, P < 0.001, P = 0.006, respectively) and chemoradiotherapy was significantly superior than simple chemotherapy (DFS, P = 0.031; OS, P = 0.027). For patients with an intermediate-risk score, postoperative chemoradiotherapy showed a statistically significant survival advantage over no anticancer treatment (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively), while chemotherapy did not. Compared with no adjuvant treatment, neither postoperative chemoradiotherapy nor chemotherapy made significant difference for patients in the high-risk group. Combining the value of immune-risk status and chemosensitivity, the immune-risk score could not only offer us prognostic evaluation and adjuvant treatment guidance, but also improve our understanding about the binding point between chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and the immune system, which may be helpful for further expanding the application of immunotherapy.",

There has been no investigation to find a robust signature to predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients in the aspect of tumor immunology. In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways.

Predictive biomarkers are needed to select patients who will benefit from the treatment and spare others the toxicity and burden of radiation.Experimental Design: We first trained and tested an intrinsic radiosensitivity gene signature to predict local recurrence after radiotherapy in three cohorts of 948 patients. Next, we developed an antigen processing and presentation-based immune signature by maximizing the treatment interaction effect in 129 patients. To test their predictive value, we matched patients treated with or without radiotherapy in an independent validation cohort for clinicopathologic factors including age, ER status, HER2 status, stage, hormone-therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was the primary endpoint.Results: Our validation cohort consisted of 1,439 patients. After matching and stratification by the radiosensitivity signature, patients who received radiotherapy had better DSS than patients who did not in the radiation-sensitive group [hazard ratio (HR), 0.68; P = 0.059; n = 322], whereas a reverse trend was observed in the radiation-resistant group (HR, 1.53; P = 0.059; n = 202). Similarly, patients treated with radiotherapy had significantly better DSS in the immune-effective group (HR, 0.46; P = 0.0076; n = 180), with no difference in DSS in the immune-defective group (HR, 1.27; P = 0.16; n = 348). Both signatures were predictive of radiotherapy benefit (Pinteraction = 0.007 and 0.005). Integration of radiosensitivity and immune signatures further stratified patients into three groups with differential outcomes for those treated with or without radiotherapy (Pinteraction = 0.003).Conclusions: The proposed signatures have the potential to select patients who are most likely to benefit from radiotherapy.

Systematic construction of an LncRNA Modulator Atlas in Pan-cancer (LncMAP) reveals distinct types of lncRNA regulatory molecules, which are expressed in multiple tissues, exhibit higher conservation.

The predominant cause of late graft loss is antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), a process whereby injury to the organ is caused by donor-specific antibodies, which bind to HLA and non-HLA (nHLA) antigens. AMR is incompletely diagnosed as donor/recipient (D/R) matching is only limited to the HLA locus and critical nHLA immunogenic antigens remain to be identified. We have developed an integrative computational approach leveraging D/R exome sequencing and gene expression to predict clinical post-transplant outcome. We performed a rigorous statistical analysis of 28 highly annotated D/R kidney transplant pairs with biopsy-confirmed clinical outcomes of rejection [either AMR or T-cell-mediated rejection (CMR)] and no-rejection (NoRej), identifying a significantly higher number of mismatched nHLA variants in AMR (ANOVA-p-value = 0.02). Using Fisher's exact test, we identified 123 variants associated mainly with risk of AMR (p-value < 0.001). In addition, we applied a machine-learning technique to circumvent the issue of statistical power and we found a subset of 65 variants using random forest, that are predictive of post-tx AMR showing a very low error rate. These variants are functionally relevant to the rejection process in the kidney and AMR as they relate to genes and/or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that are enriched in genes expressed in kidney and vascular endothelium and underlie the immunobiology of graft rejection. In addition to current D/R HLA mismatch evaluation, additional mismatch nHLA D/R variants will enhance the stratification of post-tx AMR risk even before engraftment of the organ. This innovative study design is applicable in all solid organ transplants, where the impact of mitigating AMR on graft survival may be greater, with considerable benefits on improving human morbidity and mortality and opens the door to precision immunosuppression and extended tx survival.",

Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.",DOI 10.1128/mSphere.00245-17.

However, one crucial and limiting factor in data reuse is accurate, structured and complete description of the data or data about the data-defined as metadata. We propose a framework to predict structured metadata terms from unstructured metadata for improving quality and quantity of metadata, using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray database. Our framework consists of classifiers trained using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features and a second approach based on topics modeled using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) to reduce the dimensionality of the unstructured data. Our results on the GEO database show that structured metadata terms can be the most accurately predicted using the TF-IDF approach followed by LDA both outperforming the majority vote baseline. While some accuracy is lost by the dimensionality reduction of LDA, the difference is small for elements with few possible values, and there is a large improvement over the majority classifier baseline. Overall this is a promising approach for metadata prediction that is likely to be applicable to other datasets and has implications for researchers interested in biomedical metadata curation and metadata prediction.",

Most studies have profiled expression of select genes or proteins in peripheral blood, but none have focused on the expression of canonical pathways that mediate overall immune response. The current study used a systematic genetic approach to investigate the role of the immune system in a large sample of post-mortem brain of patients with schizophrenia: RNA sequencing was performed to assess the differential expression of 561 immune genes and 20 immune pathways in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (144 schizophrenia and 196 control subjects) and hippocampus (83 schizophrenia and 187 control subjects). The effect of RNA quality on gene expression was found to be highly correlated with the effect of diagnosis even after adjustment for observable RNA quality parameters (i.e. RNA integrity), thus this confounding relationship was statistically controlled using principal components derived from the gene expression matrix. In DLPFC, 23 immune genes were found to be differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05), of which seven genes replicated in both directionality and at nominal significance (P<0.05) in an independent post-mortem DLPFC data set (182 schizophrenia and 212 control subjects), although notably at least five of these genes have prominent roles in pathways other than immune function and overall the effect sizes were minimal (fold change <1.1). In the hippocampus, no individual immune genes were identified to be differentially expressed, and in both DLPFC and hippocampus none of the individual immune pathways were relatively differentially expressed. Further, genomic schizophrenia risk profiles scores were not correlated with the expression of individual immune pathways or differentially expressed genes. Overall, past reports claiming a primary pathogenic role of the immune system intrinsic to the brain in schizophrenia could not be confirmed.",

We found that the expression changes of IRGs were different between LUAD and LUSC. Cell cycle promoting genes, including KIFs and proteasomes, showed faster up-regulation in LUSC, whereas immune response promoting genes, including MHC molecules and chemokines, were more rapidly repressed in LUSC. Comparative pathway analysis revealed that members of the Toll-like receptor and T cell receptor signaling pathways exhibited diverged expression changes between LUAD and LUSC, especially at the early cancer stages.

Herein we evaluated transcriptomic changes of wounds as they counter P. aeruginosa infection-first active infection, and then chronic biofilm infection. We used the dermal full-thickness, rabbit ear excisional wound model. We studied the wound response: towards acute infection at 2, 6, and 24 hrs after inoculating 106 bacteria into day-3 wounds; and, towards more chronic biofilm infection of wounds similarly infected for 24 hrs but then treated with topical antibiotic to coerce biofilm growth and evaluated at day 5 and 9 post-infection. The wounds were analyzed for bacterial counts, expression of P. aeruginosa virulence and biofilm-synthesis genes, biofilm morphology, infiltrating immune cells, re-epithelialization, and genome-wide gene expression (RNA-Seq transcriptome). This analysis revealed that 2 hrs after bacterial inoculation into day-3 wounds, the down-regulated genes (infected vs. non-infected) of the wound edge were nearly all non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), comprised of snoRNA, miRNA, and RNU6 pseudogenes, and their down-regulation preceded a general down-regulation of skin-enriched coding gene expression. As the active infection intensified, ncRNAs remained overrepresented among down-regulated genes; however, at 6 and 24 hrs they changed to a different set, which overlapped between these times, and excluded RNU6 pseudogenes but included snRNA components of the major and minor spliceosomes. Additionally, the raw counts of multiple types of differentially-expressed ncRNAs increased on post-wounding day 3 in control wounds, but infection suppressed this increase. After 5 and 9 days, these ncRNA counts in control wounds decreased, whereas they increased in the infected, healing-impaired wounds. These data suggest a sequential and coordinated change in the levels of transcripts of multiple major classes of ncRNAs in wound cells transitioning from inflammation to the proliferation phase of healing.",

Recent technological advances in repertoire profiling via high-throughput sequencing have resulted in an explosion of research activity in the field. This has been accompanied by a proliferation of software tools for analysis of repertoire sequencing data.

These data provide a springboard for scientific advances in precision medicine but the question arises as to how representative clinical trials data are of cancer patients overall. Here we present the integrative analysis of data from several cancer clinical trials and compare these to patient-level data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Comparison of cancer type-specific survival rates reveals that these are overall lower in trial subjects. This effect, at least to some extent, can be explained by the more advanced stages of cancer of trial subjects. This analysis also reveals that for stage IV cancer, colorectal cancer patients have a better chance of survival than breast cancer patients. On the other hand, for all other stages, breast cancer patients have better survival than colorectal cancer patients. Comparison of survival in different stages of disease between the two datasets reveals that subjects with stage IV cancer from the trials dataset have a lower chance of survival than matching stage IV subjects from TCGA. One likely explanation for this observation is that stage IV trial subjects have lower survival rates since their cancer is less likely to respond to treatment. To conclude, we present here a newly available clinical trials dataset which allowed for the integration of patient-level data from many cancer clinical trials. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that cancer-related clinical trials are not representative of general cancer patient populations, mostly due to their focus on the more advanced stages of the disease. These and other limitations of clinical trials data should, perhaps, be taken into consideration in medical research and in the field of precision medicine. ",

We take advantage of emerging community-based standard templates for describing different kinds of biomedical datasets, and we investigate the use of computational techniques to help investigators to assemble templates and to fill in their values. We are creating a repository of metadata from which we plan to identify metadata patterns that will drive predictive data entry when filling in metadata templates. The metadata repository not only will capture annotations specified when experimental datasets are initially created, but also will incorporate links to the published literature, including secondary analyses and possible refinements or retractions of experimental interpretations. By working initially with the Human Immunology Project Consortium and the developers of the ImmPort data repository, we are developing and evaluating an end-to-end solution to the problems of metadata authoring and management that will generalize to other data-management environments.

Here, we demonstrate that an N-terminal proline-rich interaction region is crucial for Foxp3's function. Subdomains within this key region link Foxp3 to several independent mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Our study suggests that Foxp3, even in the absence of its DNA-binding forkhead domain, acts as a bridge between DNA-binding interaction partners and proteins with effector function permitting it to regulate a large number of genes. We show that, in one such mechanism, Foxp3 recruits class I histone deacetylases to the promoters of target genes, counteracting activation-induced histone acetylation and thereby suppressing their expression.

However, the development of vaccines against global pandemics such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis has been obstructed by several challenges. A major challenge is the lack of knowledge about the correlates and mechanisms of protective immunity. Recent advances in the application of systems biological approaches to analyse immune responses to vaccination in humans are beginning to yield new insights about mechanisms of vaccine immunity, and to define molecular signatures, induced rapidly after vaccination, that correlate with and predict vaccine induced immunity. Here, we review these advances and discuss the potential of this systems vaccinology approach in defining novel correlates of protection in clinical trials, and in infection-induced 'experimental challenge models' in humans.

However, vaccines have historically been developed empirically, and recent development of vaccines against current pandemics such as HIV and malaria has been met with difficulty. The advent of high-throughput technologies, coupled with systems biological methods of data analysis, has enabled researchers to interrogate the entire complement of a variety of molecular components within cells, and characterize the myriad interactions among them in order to model and understand the behavior of the system as a whole. In the context of vaccinology, these tools permit exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines induce protective immune responses. Here we review the recent advances, challenges, and potential of systems biological approaches in vaccinology. If the challenges facing this developing field can be overcome, systems vaccinology promises to empower the identification of early predictive signatures of vaccine response, as well as novel and robust correlates of protection from infection. Such discoveries, along with the improved understanding of immune responses to vaccination they impart, will play an instrumental role in development of the next generation of rationally designed vaccines.

These microbes are not passive riders but rather a vital component of the organism. The human microbiota affects our health in multiple ways, both positively and negatively. One of the new attractive directions in microbiome biology is the ""microbiome-brain axis"". Several groups of researchers have described the ability of the gut microbiota to communicate with the brain and thus modulate human behavior. These limited experimental data became the foundation of the ""biomeme hypothesis"" of possible microbial origin of some religious rituals that has recently appeared in Biology Direct. Here I propose a critical analysis of this hypothesis. I conclude that there is no evidence of the microbial origin of religious practices but there are strong indications of their psychological and social roots. ",

The major determinant of this control is host expression of certain major histocompatibility complex alleles. However, this association is incompletely penetrant, suggesting that additional loci modify the major histocompatibility complex's protective effect. Here, to identify candidate control-modifying loci, we sequence the genomes of 12 SIV-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques that experienced divergent viral load set points despite sharing the protective M1 major histocompatibility complex haplotype.",
