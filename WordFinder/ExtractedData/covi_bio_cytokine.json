In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines.

Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.\n\nMethodsWe did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.\n\nFindingsBetween June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.\n\nFindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.\n\nInterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart.

In the present study, for the first time, we demonstrate the oral microbiota structure and inflammatory profile of COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls underwent naso/oral-pharyngeal and oral swabs. Microbiota structure was analyzed by 16S rRNA V2 automated targeted sequencing, while oral and sera concentrations of 27 cytokines were assessed using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays. A significant diminution in species richness was observed in COVID-19 patients, along with a marked difference in beta-diversity. Species such as Prevotella salivae and Veillonella infantium were distinctive for COVID-19 patients, while Neisseria perflava and Granulicatella elegans were predominant in controls. Interestingly, these two groups of oral species oppositely clustered within the bacterial network, defining two distinct Species Interacting Group (SIGs). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were distinctive for COVID-19 in both oral and serum samples, and we found a specific bacterial consortium able to counteract them, following a novel index called C4 firstly proposed here. We even introduced a new parameter, named CytoCOV, able to predict COVID-19 susceptibility for an unknown subject at 71% of power with an AUC equal to 0.995. This pilot study evidenced a distinctive oral microbiota composition in COVID-19 subjects, with a definite structural network in relation to secreted cytokines.

Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection.

Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. Here we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins Spike (S) and Envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling interferon (IFN) pathway in both immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human and murine specific IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88 while that of E is largely MYD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells. These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 robustly activates widespread inflammation, but we do not understand mechanistically how the virus engages the immune system. This knowledge will facilitate the development of critically needed therapeutic strategies to promote beneficial immune responses will dampening harmful inflammation.

This activation occurred in both immune and epithelial cells, and mechanistic studies demonstrated dependence on known key inflammatory signaling mediators, IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88. In animal studies, we showed that these viral surface proteins induce epithelial cell IFN-dependent lung pathology, reminiscent to acute COVID-19 pulmonary infection.

In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients.

One strategy that has gained significant interest is to  repurpose existing licensed vaccines for use against COVID-19. In this report, we have exploited the immunostimulatory properties of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the vaccine for tuberculosis, to develop a SARS-CoV-2-specific and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate. Combination of BCG with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen promoted rapid development of virus-specific IgG antibodies in the sera of vaccinated mice, which could be further augmented by the addition of alum. This vaccine formulation, termed BCG:CoVac, induced a Th1-biased response both in terms of IgG antibody subclass and cytokine release by vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A single dose of BCG:CoVac was sufficient to induce high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that were detectable as early as 2 weeks post-vaccination; NAb levels were greater than that seen in the sera of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Boosting of BCG:CoVac-primed mice with a heterologous vaccine combination (spike protein plus alum) could further increase SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibody response. BCG:CoVac would be broadly applicable for all populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and in particular could be readily incorporated into current vaccine schedules in countries where BCG is currently used.\n\nImportanceEffective distribution of vaccine to low- and middle-income countries is critical for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, vaccines must offer effective protective immunity yet should be cheap to manufacture and meet cold chain management requirements. This study describes a unique COVID-19 vaccine candidate, termed BCG:CoVac, that when delivered as a single dose induces potent SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in mice, particularly through generation of high-titre, anti-viral neutralising antibodies. BCG:CoVac is built on safe and well-characterised vaccine components: 1) the BCG vaccine, used for control of tuberculosis since 1921 which also has remarkable  off target effects, protecting children and the elderly against diverse respiratory viral infections; 2) Alhydrogel adjuvant (Alum), a low cost, globally accessible vaccine adjuvant with an excellent safety record in humans (part of >20 licensed human vaccines and in use >70 years); 3) Stabilized, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which stimulates immune specificity for COVID-19.

While SARS-CoV-2 infections are often benign, there are also severe COVID-19 cases, characterized by severe bilobar pneumonia that can decompensate to an acute respiratory distress syndrome, notably characterized by increased inflammation and a cytokine storm. While there is no cure against severe COVID-19 cases, some treatments significantly decrease the severity of the disease, notably aspirin and dexamethasone, which both directly or indirectly target the biosynthesis (and effects) of numerous bioactive lipids.\n\nOBJECTIVEOur working hypothesis was that severe COVID-19 cases necessitating mechanical ventilation were characterized by increased bioactive lipid levels modulating lung inflammation. We thus quantitated several lung bioactive lipids using liquid chromatography combined to tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nRESULTSWe performed an exhaustive assessment of the lipid content of bronchoalveolar lavages from 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients necessitating mechanical ventilation. Severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acid levels as well as an accompanying inflammatory lipid storm. As such, most quantified bioactive lipids were heavily increased. There was a predominance of cyclooxygenase metabolites, notably TXB2 >> PGE2 [~] 12-HHTrE > PGD2. Leukotrienes were also increased, notably LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, LTE4, and eoxin E4. 15-lipoxygenase metabolites derived from linoleic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were also increased. Finally, yet importantly, specialized pro-resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A4 and the D-series resolvins, were also found at important levels, underscoring that the lipid storm occurring in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections involves pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur data unmask the important lipid storm occurring in the lungs of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19.

The primary outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death, and secondary outcomes were a decrease in oxygen requirement and inflammatory markers; the incidence of secondary infections, and renal or hepatic dysfunction. Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log rank test were used for evaluating primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test.\n\nResultsAmong 1081 patients admitted during the study period, 125 were administered TCZ (median age, 56 [95% CI 54 - 60] years; 100 [80%] male).

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to infect humans, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The host response to CoV infection is complex and regulated, in part, by intracellular antiviral signaling pathways triggered in the first cells that are infected. Emerging evidence suggests that CoVs hijack these antiviral responses to reshape the production of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that mediate decay or translational suppression of cellular mRNAs; this is particularly relevant for proinflammatory cytokine mRNA which normally reside in PBs and are repressed. Emerging evidence also suggests that PBs or their components play important direct-acting antiviral roles, providing a compelling reason for their frequent disassembly by many viruses. No information is known about how human CoVs impact PBs. Here, we provide data to show that infection with the human CoV, OC43, causes PB disassembly. Moreover, we show that several SARS-CoV-2 gene products also mediate PB loss and virus-induced PB loss correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs that would normally be repressed in PBs. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulating PB formation prior to OC43 infection restricts viral replication. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs disassemble PBs during infection to support viral replication and evade innate immune responses.

We have measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the respiratory samples and serum markers of inflammation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. We observed a bi-phasic pattern of virus load which was eventually cleared in most patients at the time of discharge. Viral load in saliva samples from a subset of patients showed good correlation with nasopharyngeal samples. Serum interferon levels were downregulated during early stages of infection but peaked at later stages correlating with elevated levels of T-cell cytokines and other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF- which showed a bi-phasic pattern.

After inoculation with a low passage SARS-CoV-2 isolate, clinical, virological, and immunological characteristics were monitored.\n\nBoth species showed slightly elevated body temperatures in the first days after exposure while a decrease in physical activity was only observed in the rhesus macaques and not in cynomolgus macaques. The virus was quantified in tracheal, nasal, and anal swabs, and in blood samples by qRT-PCR, and showed high similarity between the two species. Immunoglobulins were detected by various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and showed seroconversion in all animals by day 10 post-infection. The cytokine responses were highly comparable between species and computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed pulmonary lesions in all animals. Consequently, we concluded that both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques represent valid models for evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral candidates in a preclinical setting.\n\nAuthor summarySARS-CoV-2 infection can have a wide range of symptoms. It can cause asymptomatic or mild disease, but can also have a severe, potentially deadly outcome. Vaccines and antivirals will therefore be crucial in fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic. For testing these prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, and investigating the progression of infection and disease development, animal models play an essential role. In this study, we compare the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Both species showed moderate disease symptoms as shown by pulmonary lesions by CT imaging. Shedding of infectious virus from the respiratory system was also documented. This study provides a detailed description of the pathogenesis of a low-passage SARS-CoV-2 isolate in two macaque models and suggests that both species represent an equally good model in research for both COVID-19 prophylactic and therapeutic treatments."], "10.1101/2020.11.04.361576": ["Wei Li, Shuai Yang, Peng Xu, Dapeng Zhang, Ying Tong, Lu Chen, Ben Jia, Ang Li, Daoping Ru, Baolong Zhang, Mengxing Liu, Cheng Lian, Cancan Chen, Weihui Fu, Songhua Yuan, Xiaoguang Ren, Ying Liang, Zhicong Yang, Wenxuan Li, Shaoxuan Wang, Xiaoyan Zhang, Hongzhou Lu, Jianqing Xu, Hailing Wang, Wenqiang Yu, Vattipally B Sreenu, Jay Nix, Ruth F Jarrett, Martina Beltramello, Kyriaki Nomikou, Matteo Pizzuto, Lily Tong, Elisabetta Cameroni, Natasha Johnson, Arthur Wickenhagen, Alessandro Ceschi, Daniel Mair, Paolo Ferrari, Katherine Smollett, Federica Sallusto, Stephen Carmichael, Christian Garzoni, Jenna Nichols, Massimo Galli, Joseph Hughes, Agostino Riva, Antonia Ho, Peter JM Openshaw, Kenneth Baillie, - The ISARIC4C Investigators, - COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, Suzannah J Rihn, Samantha J Lycett, Herbert W Virgin, Amalio Telenti, Davide Corti, David L Robertson, Gyorgy Snell, Lingxiao Wang, Lisa White, Pan Xu, Yupeng Yang, Osman N Yogurtcu, Weitong Zhang, Yanting Zhao, Difan Zou, Matthew Ferrari, David Pannell, Michael Tildesley, Jack Seifarth, Elyse Johnson, Matthew Biggerstaff, Michael Johansson, Rachel B Slayton, John Levander, Jeff Stazer, Jessica Salermo, Michael C Runge", "10.1101/2020.11.04.361576", "Human Identical Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Promote Clinical Progression of COVID-19 by Upregulating Hyaluronan via NamiRNA-Enhancer Network", "The COVID-19 pandemic is a widespread and deadly public health crisis. The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as \"human identical sequences (HIS)\". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

It is an enveloped virus with spike (S) protein attached that facilitates its receptor binding on the surface. Although it has brought about the global interest for the researchers and medical practitioner in the identification of potential targets that may be addressed in order to cope up with the situation. In the current study potential role of cytokines and related inflammatory markers have been identified that interplays in the progression of disease in COVID-19 patients.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODSCurrent study substitutes hundred and fifty (n=150) patients with novel-COVID-19 and hundred (n=100) healthy controls. After getting informed consent serum samples of the participants were collected and analyzed for their significance in the disease progression. Levels of Interleukins i.e., (IL- 1,6,8,10,11) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) were determined with help of their specific spectrophotometric and ELISA methods.\n\nRESULTSFindings of study show significant increase in the levels of interleukins and TNF- that signifies the presence of \"cytokine storm\" in worsening the condition in respect to the exposure of COVID-19. Levels of IL-1 and 6 were significantly higher in patients (98.69{+/-}39.35pg/ml and 71.95{+/-}28.41 pg/ml) as compared to controls (30.06{+/-}14.19pg/ml and 9.46{+/-}3.43pg/ml) where, (p=0.001 and 0.007).

It is accepted that BCG alleviates both pathogen and allergy induced respiratory diseases that could also include Covid-19. To investigate this possibility, we randomly assigned 60 Covid-19 patients, after admission to the hospital with pneumonia and requirement for oxygen therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single adult dose of intradermal BCG or normal saline with concomitant standard of care (SoC) medications. Primary endpoints were favorable prognosis of Covid-19 as deduced from resolution of pneumonia, viremia and secondary outcome were enumeration of ICU admissions, duration thereof and mortalities.\n\nResultsBoth primary and secondary endpoints were significantly improved in the BCG+SoC group. This could be seen from reduction in oxygen requirement due to Covid-19 associated pneumonia decreasing from day 3-4, improved radiological resolution from day 7-15. There were a total of 6 (10%) adverse events in the study of which 2 deaths and 4 ICU admissions were in SoC group (1 ICU admission culminated in death of the subject) and in contrast only 1 ICU admission in the BCG+SoC group. While there was an increase in Covid-19 specific IgG levels in the BCG+SoC group, there was no evidence of BCG induced cytokine storm in this group. Four patients showed localized inflammatory response at the injection site in the BCG+SoC group.\n\nConclusionsBCG+SoC administration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with favorable outcomes than did SoC. A third of the patients were naive for childhood BCG vaccination. This mimicked elderly patients in countries with no universal vaccination policy for BCG. No BCG related adversity was seen in this group.

Deletion of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis mediators individually was not sufficient to protect against cell death. However, cells deficient in both RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were resistant to this cell death. Mechanistically, the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis activated by TNF- and IFN-{gamma} co-treatment induced iNOS for the production of nitric oxide. Pharmacological and genetic deletion of this pathway inhibited pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of PANoptosis protected mice from TNF- and IFN-{gamma}-induced lethal cytokine shock that mirrors the pathological symptoms of COVID-19. In vivo neutralization of both TNF- and IFN-{gamma} in multiple disease models associated with cytokine storm showed that this treatment provided substantial protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock models, demonstrating the broad physiological relevance of this mechanism. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other cytokine storm-driven syndromes by limiting inflammation and tissue damage. The findings also provide a molecular and mechanistic description for the term cytokine storm. Additionally, these results open new avenues for the treatment of other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases and cancers where TNF- and IFN-{gamma} synergism play key pathological roles."], "10.1101/2020.10.28.358945": ["Antoine Rebendenne, Ana Luiza Chaves Valad\u00e3o, Marine Tauziet, Ghizlane Maarifi, Boris Bonaventure, R\u00e9mi Plan\u00e8s, Joe McKellar, S\u00e9bastien Nisole, Mary Arnaud-Arnould, Olivier Moncorg\u00e9, Caroline Goujon, Nicholas A.

This inflammatory response results from assembly/activation of a cell-intrinsic defense platform known as the inflammasome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by ORF3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the most promiscuous of known inflammasomes. ORF3a triggers IL-1{beta} expression via NF{kappa}B, thus priming the inflammasome while also activating it via ASC-dependent and -independent modes. ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation requires efflux of potassium ions and oligomerization between NEK7 and NLRP3. With the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 able to block ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation and key ORF3a residues needed for virus release and inflammasome activation conserved in SARS-CoV-2 isolates across continents, ORF3a and NLRP3 present prime targets for intervention.\n\nSummaryDevelopment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies is aimed predominantly at blocking infection or halting virus replication. Yet, the inflammatory response is a significant contributor towards disease, especially in those severely affected. In a pared-down system, we investigate the influence of ORF3a, an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, on the inflammatory machinery and find that it activates NLRP3, the most prominent inflammasome by causing potassium loss across the cell membrane.

Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells. Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven COVID-19 progression."], "10.1101/2020.10.14.339952": ["Marian Kalocsay, Zoltan Maliga, Ajit J Nirmal, Robyn J Eisert, Gary A Bradshaw, Yu-An Chen, Roxanne J Pelletier, Connor A Jacobson, Julian Mintseris, Amanda J Martinot, Dan H Barouch, Peter Sorger, Mirta Roses, Vasee Sathiyamoorthy, John-Arne Rottingen, Soumya Swaminathan, Qingyuan Yang, David Hines, William Clarke, Richard Eric Rothman, Andrew Pekosz, Katherine Fenstermacher, Zitong Wang, Scott L Zeger, Antony Rosen", "10.1101/2020.10.14.339952", "Multiplexed proteomics and imaging of resolving and lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung", "Normal tissue physiology and repair depends on communication with the immune system.

While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response which if severe may lead to a state of functional immunoparalysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was peak COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. Additional endpoints included COVID-19 severity at ED disposition, development of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) or secondary bacterial infections. Results: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease at both time points (all p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe AKI and secondary bacterial infection (all p[&le;]0.01).

SARS-CoV-2 infects the lungs and may cause several immune-related complications such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality . The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is not fully understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Once inside T helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 assembles viral factories, impairs cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infected T helper cells express higher amounts of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients."], "10.1101/2020.09.28.316604": ["Mohammed Uddin, Tom Loney, Norbert Nowotny, Hanan Alsuwaidi, Rupa Varghese, Zulfa Deesi, Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh, Hamda Khansaheb, Alawi Alsheikh-Ali, Weiqun Shen, Benjamin Blair, Na Du, Kyndal Morais, Kate Lawrence, Lucy Lu, Chin-I Pai, Donghui Li, Mark Brunswick, Yanliang Zhang, Henry Ji, Slobodan Paessler, Robert D Allen", "10.1101/2020.09.28.316604", "Host transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate, and severe clinical outcomes", "Characterizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in COVID-19 is essential for disease prognosis and management.

Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.Methods: We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays Results: Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was [&ge;] 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3% and specificity for 95.8%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p<0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p<0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels. Conclusion: Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality.

Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-{beta}) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1-and M2-type macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased, likely related to massive emigration into tissues.

Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%).

It is not clear whether the use of biologic agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARSCoV2 infection however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID19 occur as result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production.

Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear. Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (Beta; [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75E-06 and Beta; [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76E-06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation.

The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM).

Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes.

Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery.

This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg/day equivalent (0.01 ug/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients.

Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) case series studies (number of reported patients in each study equal to or greater than ten (ii) use of tocilizumab alone or in combination with standard of care therapy (iii) Covid 19 adult patients (iv) the studies with endpoints on all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvements. Data synthesis and statistical analysis Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS 18 were selected for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). 14 studies were retrospective and 4 were prospective Meta-analysis The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab was 21% (251/1212) Asymmetric funnel plot in the cylindrical form due to publication bias In conclusion the present synthesis provide us useful insights with the other available evidence to refine our strategy and equip ourselves effectively with tocilizumab to defeat COVID 19 to save humanity. Limitations The included studies utilized varied doses of tocilizumab (single or double), and duration drug availability issues emerged in some centers, which may have influenced both sample sizes and study designs. Clinical implications: Incorporated studies without control groups into systematic reviews and quantitative synthesis especially when there are no other studies to consider can provide information for formulating effective treatment strategies for management of COVID 19 infections through the use of tocilizumab.

G-CSF is both a growth factor and cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients, who are also afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains unknown. Methods: An observational cohort of 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia (N=55) and G-CSF administration (N=16) on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were assessed as time-dependent predictors using an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, a similar model was constructed with patients that received G-CSF, categorized into high- and low-response, based on the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rise 24 hours after growth factor administration. Results: Neutropenia (ANC < 1 K/mcL) during COVID-19 course was not independently associated with severe respiratory failure or death (HR: 0.71, 95% Cl: 0.34-1.50, P value: 0.367) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. When controlling for neutropenia, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06-8.28, P value: 0.038). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.61-16.64, P value: 0.006). Conclusion: Possible risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be weighed in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, as G-CSF may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status in this setting."], "10.1101/2020.08.11.20172775": ["Leora Horwitz, Simon A.

However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors. Methods We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed/expected (O/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent. Results We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16). Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks. Discussion In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period. Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain.

However, how COVID-19 infection induce cytokine storm is still largely unknown.

The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system with symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms. The bacteria resident in our gastrointestinal tract, known as gut microbiota, is important to maintain the homeostasis of our immune system.

Most histologic studies come from post-mortem analysis, with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases. However, this observation may be misleading, due to confounding factors in pre-terminal disease, including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ante-mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights, potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. AIM This comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was planned to identify ante-mortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with Covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease, including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering. METHODS Enrolled patients underwent lung biopsy, according to the study protocol approved by local Ethical Committee, either within 15 days of the first symptoms appearing (early phase) or after > 15 days (more advanced disease). Key exclusion criteria were excessive or uncorrectable bleeding risk and cardiovascular disease with heart failure. Lung samples were obtained by conventional trans-bronchialbiopsy, trans-bronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy. RESULTS 23 patients were enrolled: 12 patients underwent lung biopsy within 15 days and 11 patients more than 15 days after the onset of symptoms. Early biopsies were characterized by spots of patchy acute lung injury (ALI) with alveolar type II cells hyperplasia and significant vascular abnormalities (disordered angiogenesis with alveolar capillary hyperplasia, luminal enlargement and thickened walls of pulmonary venules, perivascularCD4-T-cell infiltration), with no hyaline membranes. In the later stages, the alveolar architecture appeared disrupted, with areas of organizing ALI, venular congestion and capillary thromboembolic microangiopathy. Striking phenotypic features were demonstrated in hyper plastic pneumocytes and endothelial cells, including the expression of phospho-STAT3 and molecules involved in immunoinhibitory signals (PD-L1 and IDO1). Alveolar macrophages exhibited macrophage-related markers (CD68, CD11c, CD14) together with unusual markers, such as DC-Lamp/CD208, CD206, CD123/IL3AR. CONCLUSION A morphologically distinct Covid pattern was identified in the earlier stages of the disease, with prominent epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities, that may be potentially reversible, differing strikingly from findings in classical diffuse alveolar damage.

This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients.

This is in part because in vitro models are typically epithelial cell monocultures or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology. We use a vascularised lung-on-chip model where, consistent with monoculture reports, low numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virions are released apically from alveolar epithelial cells. However, rapid infection of the underlying endothelial layer leads to the generation of clusters of endothelial cells with low or no CD31 expression, a progressive loss of endothelial barrier integrity, and a pro-coagulatory microenvironment. These morphological changes do not occur if these cells are exposed to the virus apically. Viral RNA persists in individual cells, which generates a response that is skewed towards NF-KB mediated inflammation, is typified by IL-6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells, and is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells. Perfusion with Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of trans IL-6 signalling slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not prevent the formation of endothelial cell clusters with reduced CD31 expression.

To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [&ge;] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died.

The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment.

Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and by their ability to promote viral clearance in past coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate role of these therapies in COVID-19 patients. Methods MEDLINE and MedRxiv were searched until July 30th, 2020, including studies that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clear risk estimates or those that permitted back-calculation. Results We searched 733 studies, ultimately including four randomized and eleven non-randomized clinical trials. JAK-inhibitor recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.03-0.39, p=0.0005) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95%CI, 0.01-0.26, p=0.0005), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95%CI, 10.68-48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.85, p=0.03), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). Conclusions JAK-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the efficacy of JAK-inhibitors and Type I interferons and clinical outcomes in COVID-19."], "10.1101/2020.08.11.246314": ["Claude Kwe Yinda, Julia R Port, Trenton J Bushmaker, Irene Offei Owusu, Victoria A Avanzato, Robert J Fischer, Jonathan E Schulz, Myndi G Holbrook, Madison J Hebner, Rebecca Rosenke, Tina Thomas, Andrea Marzi, Sonja M Best, Emmie de Wit, Carl Shaia, Neeltje van Doremalen, Vincent Munster, Luca Coppeda, Andrea Magrini, Alessandro Miani, Loredana Sarmati, Prisco Piscitelli, Nicola Moricca, Stefano Sabatini, Andrea Di Lorenzo, Ilaria Iannuzzi, Felice Rosapepe, Pier Luigi Bartoletti, Massimo Andreoni, Piera Valenti, Luca Bianchi", "10.1101/2020.08.11.246314", "K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.\n\nAuthors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation.

The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection.

Neutralizing antibody for viruses is critical for their elimination, and increased cytokine/chemokine levels are thought to be related to COVID-19 severity. However, the trend of the neutralizing antibody production and cytokine/chemokine levels during the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with differing levels of severity has not been established. Methods: We serially collected 45 blood samples from 12 patients with different levels of COVID-19 severity, and investigated the trend of neutralizing antibody production using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and cytokine/chemokine release in the patients' clinical courses. Results: All 12 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 had the neutralizing antibody against it, and the antibodies were induced at approx. 4-10 days after the patients' onsets. The antibodies in the critical and severe cases showed high neutralizing activity in all clinical courses. Most cytokine/chemokine levels were clearly high in the critical patients compared to those with milder symptoms. Conclusion: Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were induced at a high level in the severe COVID-19 patients, indicating that abundant virus replication occurred. Cytokines/chemokines were expressed more in the critical patients, indicating that high productions of cytokines/chemokines have roles in the disease severity.

Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus. Although antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early during the infection, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed regarding magnitude and persistence of antibody titer against different viral proteins and their correlation with the strength of the immune response, as measured by serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods. An ELISA assay has been developed by expressing and purifying the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Soluble Ectodomain (Spike), and full length nucleocapsid protein (N protein). Sera from healthcare workers affected by non-severe COVID-19 were longitudinally collected over four weeks, and compared to sera from patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects for the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies as well as soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in the sera. Results. Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assays were high for anti-RBD IgG and IgA (92-97%) and slightly lower for IgM and the Spike and N proteins (70-85%). The ELISA allowed quantification of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody responses against all the viral antigens tested and showed a correlation between magnitude of the antibody response and disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects showed lower antibody titers and blood pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles as compared to patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), irrespective of the antibodies tested. Noteworthy, in non-severe COVID-19 infections, antibody titers against RBD and Spike, but not against the N protein, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased within a month after viral clearance. Conclusions. Rapid decline in antibody titers and in pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a common feature of non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that antibody-mediated protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is of short duration. These results suggest caution in use serological testing to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population."], "10.1101/2020.07.29.20164699": ["Jia Huang, Song Zhai, Fangfan Ye, Song Wang, Manfei Zeng, George Way, Vipul Madarha, Tengfei Zhu, Liping Qiu, Zehui Xu, Manhua Ye, Lei Liu, Xinping Cui, Jiayu Liao, Flavio Caprioli, Pier Giuseppe Pelicci, Gioacchino Natoli, Sebastiano Pasqualato, Marina Mapelli, Federica Facciotti, Christine Mikesell, Kanokporn Mongkolrattanothai, Ted Morton, Natasha Nakra, Rosemary Olivero, Christina Osborne, Sarah Parsons, Laurie Panesar, Rupal Patel, Jennifer Schuette, Deepa Thacker, Adrina Tremoulet, Navivot Vidwan, Matthew Oster, Thoeger G.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented. Discussion/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death.

This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper. Methods & Findings Our analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April 1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care, resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every 6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies, and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020. The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7/30 (23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI 1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267) were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death.

We hypothesized the origination of these differences are based on location-dependent variations in underlying population-wide health factors. Disease prevalence or incidence data of states and counties of the United States were collected for a group of chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, physical inactivation, and common cancers (e.g., lung, colorectal, stomach, kidney and renal). Correlation and regression analysis identified the prevalence of heart failure as a significant positive factor for region-level COVID-19 mortality. Similarly, the incidence of gastric cancer and thyroid cancer were also identified as significant factors contributing to regional variation in COVID-19 mortality. To explore the implications of these results, we re-analyzed the RNA-seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and colon carcinoma (COAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We found that expression of genes in the immune response pathways were more severely disturbed in STAD than in COAD, implicating higher probability for STAD patients or individuals with precancerous chronic stomach diseases to develop cytokine storm once infected with COVID-19.

Pathway and Gene Ontology \"enrichment analysis\" revealed that PEDV infection did not stimulate expression of genes able to activate an acquired immune response, whereas MRV did so within 6h. Instead, PEDV down-regulated the expression of a set of zinc finger proteins with putative antiviral activity and enhanced the expression of the transmembrane serine protease gene TMPRSS13 (alias MSPL) to support its own infection by virus-cell membrane fusion (Shi et al, 2017, Viruses, 9(5):114).

Thus, they may degrade the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. EVs can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate conditions within them. MSC-EVs harbor major therapeutic miRNAs that play important roles in the biological functions of virus-infected host cells. Here, we examined their potential impact on viral and immune responses. MSC-EVs contained 18 miRNAs predicted to interact directly with the 3 UTR of SARS-CoV-2. These EVs suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. In addition, five major miRNAs suppressed virus activity in a luciferase reporter assay by binding the 3 UTR. MSC-EVs showed strong regenerative effects and potent anti-inflammatory activity which may prevent lethal cytokine storms. We confirmed that EVs regulated inflammatory responses by several cell types, including human brain cells that express the viral receptor ACE2, suggesting that the brain may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs in MSC-EVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2: 1) they bind specifically to the viral 3 UTR, and are thus unlikely to have side effects; 2) because the 3 UTR is highly conserved and rarely mutates, MSC-EV miRNAs could be used against novel variants arising during viral replication; and 3) unique cargoes carried by MSC-EVs can have diverse effects, such as regenerating damaged tissue and regulating immunity."], "10.1101/2020.07.27.220954": ["XianFang Liu, Longquan Lou, Lei Zhou, Angeles Mecate-Zambrano, Nadja Korthals, Volker Gerke, Stephan Ludwig, Ursula Rescher, Erin Nicholson, David Henke, Felipe-Andres Piedra, Anubama Rajan, Zeineen Momin, Kavya Kottapalli, Kristi L.

Whilst RA is not a viral respiratory syndrome, it represents a pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven chronic articular condition often accompanied by cardiovascular and lung pathologies. We hypothesised that functionally equivalent macrophage clusters in the lung might govern inflammation and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis.\n\nMethodsTo provide insight into the targetable functions of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) macrophage clusters, a comparative analysis of BALF macrophage single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) with synovial tissue (ST) macrophage scRNA-seq and functional biology was performed. The function of shared BALF and ST MerTK inflammation-resolving pathway was confirmed with inhibitor in primary macrophage-synovial fibroblast co-cultures. Results. Distinct BALF FCNpos and FCNposSPP1pos macrophage clusters emerging in severe COVID-19 patients were closely related to ST CD48highS100A12pos and CD48posSPP1pos clusters driving synovitis in active RA. They shared transcriptomic profile and pathogenic mechanisms. Healthy lung resident alveolar FABP4pos macrophages shared a regulatory transcriptomic profile, including TAM (Tyro, Axl, MerTK) receptors pathway with synovial tissue TREM2pos macrophages that govern RA remission. This pathway was substantially altered in BALF macrophages of severe COVID-19. In vitro dexamethasone inhibited tissue inflammation via macrophages MerTK function.\n\nConclusionPathogenesis and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis and RA synovitis might be driven by similar macrophage clusters and pathways.

Both neuropeptides promoted CREB activation in infected monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and also a negative regulator of NF-kB. As a possible host response to control patient inflammation, we identified that VIP levels were elevated in plasma from patients with severe forms of COVID-19, correlating with the inflammatory marker CRP and survival on those patients.

SARS-CoV-2 follows a highly variable course and it is becoming more evident that individuals immune system has a decisive influence on the progression of the disease. However, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 mediate disease pathogenesis are largely unknown. Only a few host transcriptional responses in COVID-19 have been reported so far from the Western world, but no such data has been generated from the South-Asian region yet to correlate the conjectured lower fatality around this part of the globe. In this context, we aimed to perform the transcriptomic profiling of the COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh along with the reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from these patients. Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis to demonstrate how differently the various SARS-CoV-2 infection systems are responding to the viral pathogen. We detected a unique missense mutation at 10329 position of ORF1ab gene, annotated to 3C like proteinase, which is found in 75% of our analyzed isolates; but is very rare globally. Upon the functional enrichment analyses of differentially modulated genes, we detected a similar host induced response reported earlier; this response was mainly mediated by the innate immune system, interferon stimulation, and upregulated cytokine expression etc. in the Bangladeshi patients. Surprisingly, we did not perceive the induction of apoptotic signaling, phagosome formation, antigen presentation and production, hypoxia response within these nasopharyngeal samples. Furthermore, while comparing with the other SARS-CoV-2 infection systems, we spotted that lung cells trigger the more versatile immune and cytokine signaling which was several folds higher compared to our reported nasopharyngeal samples. We also observed that lung cells did not express ACE2 in a very high amount as suspected, however, the nasopharyngeal cells are found overexpressing ACE2. But the amount of DPP4 expression within the nasal samples was significantly lower compared to the other cell types. Surprisingly, we observed that lung cells express a very high amount of integrins compared to the nasopharyngeal samples, which might suggest the putative reasons for an increased amount of viral infections in the lungs. From the network analysis, we got clues on the probable viral modulation for the overexpression of these integrins.

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been integrated into the official therapeutic protocol against COVID-19 in China. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula newly developed and specifically optimized for the treatment of COVID-19. Therapeutic administration of QFPDT resulted in an improved cure rate in mild to critically-ill patients. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of QFPDT has been poorly understood. Furthermore, the feasibility of prophylactic use in uninfected individuals remain unconfirmed. We thus examined whether the administration of QFPDT at a dose lower than recommended for therapeutic use alters hematological and/or immunological measures in healthy individuals. We found that QFPDT elevates the plasma levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, TNF-, and IL-8, which are key mediators of acute inflammatory responses to ssRNA viruses. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. Our finding suggests that the pharmacological action of QFPDT is associated with the upregulation of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines despite its clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients.

Serologic recovery in specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, and inflammatory markers occurred more rapidly following LD-RT than among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including a 3-fold risk reduction in time to clinical improvement, were observed following LD-RT compared to matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the global availability of radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts to investigate the optimal role of LD-RT in COVID-19 pneumonia are justified.

This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease.

Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"], "10.1101/2020.07.07.191007": ["Sonny R.

Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-\u03baB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone.

The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells.

The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking.

Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke.

Methods: Data from the Ontario provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data. Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules > 0.92 ) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P > 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question. Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials."], "10.1101/2020.06.23.20137596": ["Younes Zaid, Florian Puhm, Isabelle Allaeys, Abdallah Naya, Mounia Oudghiri, Loubna Khalki, Youness Limami, Nabil Zaid, Khalid Sadki, Rafiqua Ben El Haj, Wissal Maher, Lamiae Belayachi, Bouchra Belefquih, Amina Benouda, Amine Cheikh, Yahia Cherrah, Louis Flamand, Fadila Guessous, Eric Boilard, My Hedhammar, Mia Phillipson, Peter Nilsson, Sophia Hober, Charlotte Thalin", "10.1101/2020.06.23.20137596", "Platelets can contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA and are hyperactivated in COVID-19", "ABSTRACT Rationale: In addition to the overwhelming lung inflammation that prevails in COVID-19, hypercoagulation and thrombosis contribute to the lethality of subjects infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Platelets are chiefly implicated in thrombosis. Moreover, they can interact with viruses and are an important source of inflammatory mediators.

Objective: To evaluate the contribution of platelets to inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods and Results: We document the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in platelets of COVID-19 patients. Exhaustive assessment of cytokines in plasma and in platelets revealed the modulation of platelet-associated cytokine levels in COVID-19, pointing to a direct contribution of platelets to the plasmatic cytokine load. Moreover, we demonstrate that platelets release their alpha- and dense-granule contents and phosphatidylserine-exposing extracellular vesicles. Functionally, platelets were hyperactivated in COVID-19 subjects, with aggregation occurring at suboptimal thrombin concentrations. Furthermore, platelets adhered more efficiently onto collagen-coated surfaces under flow conditions.

We also compiled and curated 23 independent studies that profiled 1,855 blood samples from patients with one of six viruses (influenza, RSV, HRV, ebola, Dengue, and SARS-CoV-1).

These symptoms include low platelet count, severe hypoxia, increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, severe COVID-19 is associated with several chronic co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The identification of genetic risk factors that impact differential host responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the development of severe COVID-19, is important in gaining greater understanding into the biological mechanisms underpinning life-threatening responses to the virus. These insights could be used in the identification of high-risk individuals and for the development of treatment strategies for these patients. METHODS As of June 6, 2020, there were 976 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized, indicating they had a severe response to SARS-CoV-2. There were however too few patients with a mild form of COVID-19 to use this cohort as our control population. Instead we used similar control criteria to our previous study looking at shared genetic risk factors between severe COVID-19 and sepsis, selecting controls who had not developed sepsis despite having maximum co-morbidity risk and exposure to sepsis-causing pathogens. RESULTS Using a combinatorial (high-order epistasis) analysis approach, we identified 68 protein-coding genes that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. At the time of analysis, nine of these genes have been linked to differential response to SARS-CoV-2. We also found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors. CONCLUSION The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. Among the 68 severe COVID-19 risk-associated genes, we found several druggable protein targets and pathways. Nine are targeted by drugs that have reached at least Phase I clinical trials, and a further eight have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. Several of these targets were particularly enriched in specific co-morbidities, providing insights into shared pathological mechanisms underlying both the development of severe COVID-19, ARDS and these predisposing co-morbidities. We can use these insights to identify patients who are at greatest risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and develop targeted therapeutic strategies for them, with the aim of improving disease burden and survival rates."], "10.1101/2020.06.15.20131870": ["Yujing Song, Yuxuan Ye, Shiuan-Haur Su, Andrew Stephens, Tao Cai, Meng-Ting Chung, Meilan Han, Michael W.

However, there is no data about the best moment for its administration along the course of the disease. Methods We provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. Findings A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases. At baseline, 114 (61%) required oxygen support with FiO2 >0.5 % and 72 (39%) <0.5%. Early administration of tocilizumab, when the need of oxygen support was still below FiO2 <0.5%, was significantly more effective than given it in advanced stages (FiO2 >0.5 %), achieving lower rates of intubation or death (13% vs 37% repectively, p<0.001).

NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. We thus tested whether SARS-COV-2 would be susceptible these anti-HCV drugs. DCV consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Although less potent than DCV, SFV and its nucleoside metabolite inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Moreover, SFV/DCV combination (1:0.15 ratio) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 of 0.7:0.1 M in Calu-3 cells. SFV and DCV prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Both drugs inhibited independent events during RNA synthesis and this was particularly the case for DCV, which also targeted secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Emerging evidence links morbidity and mortality of pandemic COVID-19 pneumonia to an inflammatory cytokine storm. Methods: Eighty nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and heightened systemic inflammation (elevated serum C reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels) were treated with Tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor. Results: Clinical and laboratory improvement was seen comparing baseline and 1-2 day post-infusion indices. Among 72 patients not receiving mechanical ventilation, NEWS2 scores fell from 5 to 2 (p <0.001) C reactive protein levels fell from 95 to 14 mg/L (p <0.001) and lymphocyte counts rose from 900 to 1000/uL (p=0.036).

Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, which strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells than spike-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. They furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ to CD4+ T cell responses. Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

We aim to investigate the therapeutic effect of arbidol and moxifloxacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods We collected and analyzed data on 94 patients with COVID-19 including 27 severe patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 74 ordinary patients at general isolation ward in Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, from February 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020. All patients were treated with arbidol (100mg each time, three times a day for 14 days) and moxifloxacin (0.4g each time, once a day for 7-14 days). Other data was also collected including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes. Results In basic characteristics, compared with the ordinary patients, the severe patients were older (median age was 63.0 years V.S 57.0 years, p=0.03), had higher proportion of hypertension (30% V.S 9%, p=0.03), higher possibility of getting fatigue and/or myalgia (26% V.S 6%, p=0.03), and had more obvious dyspnea symptom (26% V.S 3%, p=0.006). In regarding to laboratory results, we found the severe patients have higher white blood cell counts (p=0.003), neutrophil counts (p=0.007), higher levels of D-dimer (p<0.001), ALT (p<0.001) and AST (p=0.013) than the ordinary patients. After treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turning negative were 69.2% in the severe group and 77.8% in the ordinary group. A peculiar phenomenon was that IL-6 stands out among the cytokines in both groups, and higher in severe group than the ordinary one (p=0.011). After treating with arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, IL-6 decreased significantly in severe group (p=0.023).

Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis.

Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to [~]50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza.

These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF- levels, particularly for CD40+ LDIBs.

By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 and interestingly, both the differentiation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and Th17 was inhibited. Meanwhile, highly activated CD4+ T-cells express PD-1 alongside macrophages that express PD-1 ligands in severe patients, suggesting that PD-1-mediated immunoregulation was partially operating. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD4+ T-cells, particularly CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells, produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, while activated CD4+ T-cells continue to promote further viral infection through the production of Furin.

These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.\n\nSignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC).

Of those patients afflicted in the United States, many have required treatment with ventilator secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data are needed regarding the benefit of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab.\n\nMethodsClinical outcomes data for patients admitted to Orange Regional Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 from Mar 15, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020 were identified through electronic health record chart review. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in confirmed COVID 19 positive patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and compared outcome in terms of mortality and length of stay amongst those who received Tocilizumab as treatment modality opposed to those that did not.\n\nResultsA total of 94 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were analyzed. 44 were in the study group and 50 in the control group. We tried to match both group as close as possible in terms of age, sex, BMI and HS score-calculated using inflammatory markers-ferritin, triglycerides, AST and fibrinogen. The median age was 55.5 years in the study group and 66 in the control group, difference was not statistically significant. Average HS score was 114 in the Tocilizumab group and 92 in the control group, difference was statistically significant with P<0.0001. Also, the patients in the study group had elevated levels of IL-6, triglycerides, AST, ferritin which were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 when compared to the control group. Length of stay was longer, average 17.9 days in the Tocilizumab.

IL-6 is the key molecule of CRS, so IL-6R antagonist Tocilizumab may be of value in improving outcomes. In our study Tocilizumab group seemed to have improved survival outcome.

Analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with a stronger response of CD4+ compared to CD8+ T-cells. Although interindividual variations for the three proteins were observed, M-protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4+ T-cells, suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19.

Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients have varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with 3-4% mortality rate. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome can be caused by tissue damage mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of such responses remain elusive, with an incomplete understanding of how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Here, we use a dynamical systems approach to dissect the emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics among virally infected cells, the immune response to it and the consequent immunopathology. By mechanistic analysis of cell-cell interactions, we have identified key parameters affecting the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19. This minimalistic yet rigorous model can explain the various phenotypes observed across the clinical spectrum of COVID-19, various co-morbidity risk factors such as age and obesity, and the effect of antiviral drugs on different phenotypes. It also reveals how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results will help further the case of rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage simultaneously.\n\nSignificance StatementThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected millions of people, and thousands of lives have been lost to it. The pandemic has already tested the limits of our public healthcare systems with a wide spectrum of clinicopathological symptoms and outcomes. The mechanistic underpinnings of the resultant immunopathology caused by the viral infection still remains to be elucidated. Here we propose a minimalistic but rigorous description of the interactions of the virus infected cells and the core components of the immune system that can potentially explain such diversity in the observed clinical outcomes.

The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated.\n\nResultsCompared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced O_SCPLOWIFNC_SCPLOW{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines.

To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles.

All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days).

Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection.

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3+ Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy.

While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known.\n\nMethodsWe performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy.\n\nResultsA unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines.\n\nConclusionWe propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population.

We observed an inverse correlation (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.84 to -1) between high CRP and 25(OH)D. Age and the family income status also correlated to high CRP and subjects with higher age and lower family income presented more incidences of high CRP. Our analysis determined a possible link between high CRP and Vit D deficiency and calculated an OR of 1.8 with 95%CI (1.2 to 2.6) among the elderly (age [&ge;] 60 yo) in low-income families and an OR of 1.9 with 95%CI (1.4 to 2.7) among the elderly (age [&ge;] 60 yo) in high-income families. COVID-19 patient-level data shows a notable OR of 3.4 with 95%CI (2.15 to 5.4) for high CRP in severe COVID-19 patients.\n\nConclusionGiven that CRP is a surrogate marker for cytokine storm and is associated with Vit D deficiency, based on retrospective data and indirect evidence we see a possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine storm.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice."], "10.1101/2020.04.07.030734": ["Jing Xing, Rama Shankar, Aleksandra Drelich, Shreya Paithankar, Eugene Chekalin, Thomas Dexheimer, Mei-Sze Chua, Surender Rajasekaran, Chien-Te Kent Tseng, Bin Chen, Yuan Sun, Shaojuan Zhao, Rui Gong, Ze Chen, Gengfu Xiao, Rita E.

Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif.

The manner in which the key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19. Compared with healthy controls, in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19, T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased. A detailed analysis of the monocytes revealed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naive B cells decreased. Our study identified several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and confirmed isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity.

COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in [~]170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms.

On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients.\n\nConclusionsOn admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19."], "10.1101/2020.03.02.20029975": ["Yang Yang, Chenguang Shen, Jinxiu Li, Jing Yuan, Minghui Yang, Fuxiang Wang, Guobao Li, Yanjie Li, Li Xing, Ling Peng, Jinli Wei, Mengli Cao, Haixia Zheng, Weibo Wu, Rongrong Zou, Delin Li, Zhixiang Xu, Haiyan Wang, Mingxia Zhang, Zheng Zhang, Lei Liu, Yingxia Liu", "10.1101/2020.03.02.20029975", "Exuberant elevation of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with disease severity and fatal outcome", "The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, December 2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health.

Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%).

All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed."], "10.1101/2020.02.12.945576": ["Yonggang Zhou, Binqing Fu, Xiaohu Zheng, Dongsheng Wang, Changcheng Zhao, Yingjie Qi, Rui Sun, Zhigang Tian, Xiaoling Xu, Haiming Wei, Laura Laloli, Linda Huesser, Manon Wider, Stephanie Pfaender, Dagny Hirt, Valentina Cippa, Silvia Crespo-Pomar, Simon Schroeder, Doreen Muth, Daniela Niemeyer, Marcel A Mueller, Christian Drosten, Ronald Dijkman, Joerg Jores, Volker Thiel, Young Yun Baek, Bryan Lewis, Madhav Marathe, Chris Barrett", "10.1101/2020.02.12.945576", "Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus", "Pathogenic human coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), cause high morbidity and mortality 1,2.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear.\n\nMETHODSWe retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases.\n\nRESULTSThe number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients ([&gt;=]60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion.\n\nCONCLUSIONST cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/L, 300/L, and 400/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition."], "10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903": ["Guang Chen, Di Wu, Wei Guo, Yong Cao, Da Huang, Hongwu Wang, Tao Wang, Xiaoyun Zhang, Huilong Chen, Haijing Yu, Xiaoping Zhang, Minxia Zhang, Shiji Wu, Jianxin Song, Tao Chen, Meifang Han, Shusheng Li, Xiaoping Luo, Jianping Zhao, Qin Ning", "10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903", "Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate forms of Coronavirus Disease 2019", "BackgroundSince late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and continued to spread throughout China and across the globe.

The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases.\n\nResultsOf the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (0.7 x 10{square}/L) than moderate cases (1.1 x 10{square}/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L).

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses.\n\nFindingsWe included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospitaladmission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a [~]5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses ([~]1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses).\n\nInterpretationTo prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history.

Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication.
