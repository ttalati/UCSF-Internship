Open-access datasets are being applied in the validation of the methods used in the original studies, leveraging studies for meta-analysis, or generating new hypotheses. To promote these goals, the ImmPort data repository was created for the broader research community to explore the wide spectrum of clinical and basic research data and associated findings. The ImmPort ecosystem consists of four components-Private Data, Shared Data, Data Analysis, and Resources-for data archiving, dissemination, analyses, and reuse. To date, more than 300 studies have been made freely available through the Shared Data portal (www.immport.org/immport-open), which allows research data to be repurposed to accelerate the translation of new insights into discoveries.",

The 5-year survival rate of patients with metastatic melanoma is low. Therefore, it is critical to identify potential effective biomarkers for diagnosis of melanoma metastasis. In the present study, the melanoma cohort and immune genes were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the ImmPort database, respectively. Then, we constructed the immune risk score (IRS) using univariate and multivariate logistic analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of IRS in sequencing samples and the initial diagnosis patients was 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. Besides, IRS could add benefits for metastasis diagnosis. For sequencing samples, IRS (OR = 16.35, 95% CI = 8.74-30.59) increased the odds for melanoma metastasis. Similar results were obtained in the initial diagnosis patients (OR = 8.93, 95% CI = 3.53-22.61). A composite nomogram was built based on IRS and clinical information with well-fitted calibration curves. We further used other independent melanoma cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to confirm the reliability and validity of the IRS (AUC > 0.75, OR > 1.04, and P value < 0.01 in all cohorts). In conclusion, IRS is significantly associated with melanoma metastasis and can be a novel effective signature for predicting the metastasis risk.",

The immune system has positive interactions with the central nervous system. Despite many studies investigating immune prognostic factors, there is no effective model to identify predictive biomarkers for GBM. Genomic data and clinical characteristic information of patients with GBM were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazard modeling. Deseq2 software was used for differential expression analysis. Immune-related genes from ImmPort Shared Data and the Cistrome Project were evaluated. The model performance was determined based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. CIBERSORT was used to assess the infiltration of immune cells. The results of differential expression analyses showed a significant difference in the expression levels of 2942 genes, comprising 1338 upregulated genes and 1604 downregulated genes (p < 0.05). A population of 24 immune-related genes that predicted GBM patient survival was identified. A risk score model established on the basis of the expressions of the 24 immune-related genes was used to evaluate a favorable outcome of GBM. Further validation using the ROC curve confirmed the model was an independent predictor of GBM (AUC = 0.869). In the GBM microenvironment, eosinophils, macrophages, activated NK cells, and follicular helper T cells were associated with prognostic risk.

In this study, the gene expression profiles and clinical data of ccRCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the cBioPortal database, respectively. IRGs were obtained from the ImmPort database. We analyzed the expression of IRGs in ccRCC, and discovered 681 that were differentially expressed between ccRCC and normal kidney tissues. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic differentially expressed IRGs (PDEIRGs). Using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we detected seven optimal PDEIRGs (PLAU, ISG15, IRF9, ARG2, RNASE2, SEMA3G and UCN) and used them to construct a risk model to predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. This model accurately stratified patients with different survival outcomes and precisely identified patients with different mutation burdens. Our findings suggest the seven PDEIRGs identified in this study are valuable prognostic predictors in ccRCC patients. These genes could be used to investigate the developmental mechanisms of ccRCC and to design individualized treatments for ccRCC patients.",

In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.",

There has been no investigation to find a robust signature to predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients in the aspect of tumor immunology. In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways. In conclusion, our study constructs a robust 15-gene signature for predicting KIRP patients' survival outcome on the basis of tumor immune environment and may provide possible relationship between prognosis and immune-related biological function.",

At genome sequence level, we detected signatures of selection from a population of ocular Ct isolates from Guinea-Bissau. Together these approaches allowed us to highlight the focus of humoral responses and hypothesise new modes of pathogen immune evasion. Children who were susceptible to frequent and/or prolonged Ct infection had a less focussed antibody response, including preferential recognition of forty-two antigens. There was evidence of positive and purifying selection across the genome, but little balancing selection. In contrast, most antigens that were associated with susceptibility were under neutral selection. These data suggest an evasion strategy in which Ct presents a large panel of irrelevant antigens to the immune system to block or misdirect protective responses.

Mice immunized with combinations of two antigens were also protected but the level of protection was not additive. TC0582 has sequence homology with the eukaryotic ATP synthase subunit A (AtpA). Therefore, to determine if immunization with TC0582, or with Chlamydia, elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with the mouse AtpA, the two proteins were printed on a microarray. Sera from mice immunized with TC0582 and/or live Chlamydia, strongly reacted with TC0582 but did not recognize the mouse AtpA. In conclusion, TC0582 may be considered as a Chlamydia vaccine candidate. ",

To identify new vaccine candidates a protein microarray was constructed by expressing the open reading frames (ORFs) from Chlamydia mouse pneumonitis (MoPn). C57BL/6, C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice were immunized either intranasally or intravaginally with live MoPn elementary bodies (EB). Two additional groups were immunized by the intramuscular plus subcutaneous routes with UV-treated EB, using CpG and Montanide as adjuvants to favor a Th1 response, or Alum, to elicit a Th2 response. Serum samples collected from the three strains of mice were tested in the microarray. The array included the expression of 909 proteins from the 921 ORFs of the MoPn genome and plasmid. A total of 530 ORFs were recognized by at least one serum sample. Of these, 36 reacted with sera from the three strains of mice immunized with live EB. These antigens included proteins that were previously described as immunogenic such as MOMP and HSP60. In addition, we uncovered new immunogens, including 11 hypothetical proteins. In summary, we have identified new immunodominant chlamydial proteins that can be tested for their ability to induce protection in animal models and subsequently in humans.",DOI 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.08.017.

In order to control this infection there is an urgent need to formulate a vaccine. Identification of protective antigens is required to implement a subunit vaccine. To identify potential antigen vaccine candidates, three strains of mice, BALB/c, C3H/HeN and C57BL/6, were inoculated with live and inactivated C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) by different routes of immunization. Using a protein microarray, serum samples collected after immunization were tested for the presence of antibodies against specific chlamydial antigens. A total of 225 open reading frames (ORF) of the C. trachomatis genome were cloned, expressed, and printed in the microarray. Using this protein microarray, a total of seven C. trachomatis dominant antigens were identified (TC0052, TC0189, TC0582, TC0660, TC0726, TC0816 and, TC0828) as recognized by IgG antibodies from all three strains of animals after immunization. In addition, the microarray was probed to determine if the antibody response exhibited a Th1 or Th2 bias. Animals immunized with live organisms mounted a predominant Th1 response against most of the chlamydial antigens while mice immunized with inactivated Chlamydia mounted a Th2-biased response. In conclusion, using a high throughput protein microarray we have identified a set of novel proteins that can be tested for their ability to protect against a chlamydial infection.",
