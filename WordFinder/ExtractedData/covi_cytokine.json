Sporting events have been canceled or postponed, and even when baseball and basketball seasons resumed in the United States recently, no fans were in attendance. As play resumed, several players developed COVID-19, disrupting some of the schedules. A hypothesis now under scientific consideration is that taking vitamin supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations could quickly reduce the risk and/or severity of COVID-19. Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation is already familiar to many athletes and sports teams because it improves athletic performance and increases playing longevity. Thus, athletes should consider vitamin D supplementation to serve as an additional means by which to reduce risk of COVID-19 and its consequences."], "7761414": ["Tianyuan Liu, Leandro Balzano-Nogueira, Ana Lleo, Ana Conesa", "7761414", "Transcriptional Differences for COVID-19 Disease Map Genes between Males and Females Indicate a Different Basal Immunophenotype Relevant to the Disease", "Worldwide COVID-19 epidemiology data indicate differences in disease incidence amongst sex and gender demographic groups. Specifically, male patients are at a higher death risk than female patients, and the older population is significantly more affected than young individuals. Whether this difference is a consequence of a pre-existing differential response to the virus, has not been studied in detail. We created DeCovid, an R shiny app that combines gene expression (GE) data of different human tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project along with the COVID-19 Disease Map and COVID-19 related pathways gene collections to explore basal GE differences across healthy demographic groups. We used this app to study differential gene expression of COVID-19 associated genes in different age and sex groups. We identified that healthy women show higher expression-levels of interferon genes. Conversely, healthy men exhibit higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, young people present a stronger complement system and maintain a high level of matrix metalloproteases than older adults. Our data suggest the existence of different basal immunophenotypes amongst different demographic groups, which are relevant to COVID-19 progression and may contribute to explaining sex and age biases in disease severity. The DeCovid app is an effective and easy to use tool for exploring the GE levels relevant to COVID-19 across demographic groups and tissues.

This paper thus sought to determine whether RA could improve baseline barrier function and attenuate TNF-\u03b1-induced barrier leak in the human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE14o- (16HBE). We show for the first time that RA increases baseline barrier function of these cell layers indicated by an 89% increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 22% decrease in 14C-mannitol flux. A simultaneous, RA-induced 70% increase in claudin-4 attests to RA affecting the tight junctional (TJ) complex itself. RA was also effective in alleviating TNF-\u03b1-induced 16HBE barrier leak, attenuating 60% of the TNF-\u03b1-induced leak to 14C-mannitol and 80% of the leak to 14C-inulin. Interleukin-6-induced barrier leak was also reduced by RA. Treatment of 16HBE cell layers with TNF-\u03b1 resulted in dramatic decrease in immunostaining for occludin and claudin-4, as well as a downward \u201cband-shift\u201d in occludin Western immunoblots.

Lastly, RA completely abrogated the TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in ERK-1,2 phosphorylation without significantly decreasing the TNF-driven increase in total ERK-1,2.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus utilizes the ACE2 receptor for cell entry in a similar way to SARS-CoV. This study investigates the regulation, gene network, and associated pathways of ACE2 that may be involved in inflammatory and cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.\nMethods: Cardiovascular traits were determined in the one of the largest mouse genetic reference populations: BXD recombinant inbred strains using blood pressure, electrocardiography, and echocardiography measurements. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, genetic correlation, and functional enrichment analysis were used to identify Ace2 regulation, gene pathway, and co-expression networks.\nResults: A wide range of variation was found in expression of Ace2 among the BXD strains. Levels of Ace2 expression are negatively correlated with cardiovascular traits, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and P wave duration and amplitude. Ace2 co-expressed genes are significantly involved in cardiac- and inflammatory-related pathways. The eQTL mapping revealed that Cyld is a candidate upstream regulator for Ace2. Moreover, the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network analysis inferred several potential key regulators (Cul3, Atf2, Vcp, Jun, Ppp1cc, Npm1, Mapk8, Set, Dlg1, Mapk14, and Hspa1b) for Ace2 co-expressed genes in the heart.\nConclusions:\nAce2 is associated with blood pressure, atrial morphology, and sinoatrial conduction in BXD mice.

This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID\u201019, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID\u201019 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID\u201019 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus.

We did an in silico study to uncover any probable other unconsidered inhibitory effects of losartan and imatinib against SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis. Reviewing the literature, we could find that over-activation of AT1R could explain precisely the mechanism of cytokine storm in COVID19. Our in silico study revealed that losartan and imatinib could probably: (1) decline SARS-CoV2 affinity to ACE2. (2) inhibit the main protease and furin, (3) disturb papain-like protease and p38MAPK functions. Our reviewing on renin-angiotensin system showed that overzealous activation of AT1R by hyper-acute excess of AngII due to acute downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV2 explains precisely the mechanism of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Besides, based on our in silico study we concluded that losartan and imatinib are promising in COVID19.\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s40203-020-00058-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."], "7716285": ["Panpan Liu, Zhijun Huang, Mingzhu Yin, Chun Liu, Xiang Chen, Pinhua Pan, Yehong Kuang", "7716285", "Safety and Efficacy of Ixekizumab and Antiviral Treatment for Patients with COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial", "A severe epidemic of COVID-19 has broken out in China and has become a major global public health event. We focus on the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-like changes and overactivation of Th17 cells (these produce cytokines) in patients with COVID-19. We aim to explore the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab (an injectable drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases) to prevent organ injury caused by the immune response to COVID-19. Ixekizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.\nThe experiment is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the open trial, 3 patients with COVID-19 are treated with ixekizumab, and the safety and efficacy are observed for 7 days. In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. This is a two-center, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial with 2-arm parallel group design (1:1 ratio).\nPatients with COVID-19 aged 18-75 with increased Interleukin (IL)-6 levels will be enrolled, but patients with severe infections requiring intensive care will be excluded. The trial will be undertaken in two centers. The first stage is carried out in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, and the second stage is carried out simultaneously in the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University.\nIn the first stage, three subjects are given ixekizumab (\u201cTaltz\u201d) (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) and antiviral therapy (\u03b1-interferon (administer 5 million U by aerosol inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (administer 100mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), chloroquine (administer 500mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), ribavirin (administer 500mg by intravenous injection two to three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), or arbidol (administer 200mg by mouth three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), but not more than 3 types). The treatment course of the first stage is 7 days.\nIn the second stage, 40 randomized patients will receive the following treatments--Group 1: ixekizumab (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) with antiviral therapy (the same scheme as in the first stage); Group 2: antiviral therapy alone (the same scheme as in the first stage). The length of the second treatment course is 14 days.\nThe primary outcome is a change in pulmonary CT severity score (an imaging tool for assessing COVID-19, which scores on the basis of all abnormal areas involved). Pulmonary CT severity score is assessed on the 7th day, 14th day, or at discharge.\nIn the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. The eLite random system of Nanjing Medical University is used for randomization.\nThe main efficacy indicator, the CT results, will be evaluated by the third-party blinded and independent research team.\nIn the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days.\nTrial registration number is ChiCTR2000030703 (version 1.7 as of March 19, 2020).

Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation.

Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPAR\u03b3:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NF\u03baB: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2\u03b1:Elongation initiation factor 2\u03b1). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT1R axis (AT1R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1.\u00a0Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity.

The opinion of the authors is that determination of protein sequence homologies across seemingly disparate viral protein libraries may provide epitope-matching data that link SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cell signatures to prior administration of cross-reacting vaccines to common viral pathogens. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 initiates diverse cellular immune responses, including the associated \u2018cytokine storm\u2019. Therefore, it is possible that the intact virus possesses a required degree of conformational matching, or stereoselectivity, to effectively target its receptor on multiple cell types. Therefore, conformational matching may be viewed as an evolving mechanism of viral infection and viral replication by an evolutionary modification of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and host cell entry.

Early identification of COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) helps to improve the outcomes. We aim to investigate whether absolute eosinophil count (AEC) can predict ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards.\nMethods: A retrospective study of 94 elderly patients older than 60 years old with COVID-19 was conducted. We compared the basic clinical characteristics and levels of inflammation markers on admission to general isolation wards and the needs for ICU transfer between the eosinopenia (AEC on admission <20 cells/\u03bcl) and non-eosinopenia (AEC \u226520 cells/\u03bcl) groups.\nResults: There was a significantly higher ICU transfer rate in the eosinopenia group than in the non-eosinopenia group (51 vs. 9%, P < 0.001).

To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy.

In an effort to reduce the severity of organ dysfunction, including respiratory insufficiency, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that block the interleukin-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab, are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. However, blocking of just one of the many cytokines involved in the inflammatory reaction may not slow down the magnitude of the process. Since timing is important, the immune deficiency induced by IL6 blockade at the late immunodeficiency phase of sepsis that follows the initial inflammatory response may be detrimental. Finally, monitoring the degree and duration of IL6 blockade may be challenging because of the long half-life of Mabs (2\u20133\u00a0weeks). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines act through a common JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can be inhibited by JAK-STAT inhibitors.

Moreover, interaction between B cells and other cellular components of the immune system or nervous system can either promote or dampen neuroinflammation depending on the disease. Given that the interest in B cells in neuroinflammation is relatively new, the precise roles that they play in the pathophysiology and progression of different neuroinflammatory disorders have not yet been well-elucidated.

We observed in patients treated with haemoadsorption a shorter LOS and shorter therapeutic support such as catecholamine dependency and duration of RRT. However, in multivariate analysis (logistic regression for mortality, competing risk for LOS), we found no significant differences between the two groups.\nThe implementation of haemoadsorption for patients in septic shock with acute renal failure did not lead to a reduction in ICU or hospital mortality rates.

The most severe symptoms are associated with overactive inflammatory immune responses, leading to a cytokine storm, tissue damage, and death, if not balanced and controlled. Hypotheses within Evolutionary Medicine, including the Hygiene/Old Friends Hypothesis, provide an important lens through which to understand and possibly control this overactive immune response. In this paper, we explore the role that infection with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs; i.e., intestinal parasitic worms) may play in dampening SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and mitigating the worst COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, STHs stimulate the immunosuppressive and regulatory T-helper 2 (TH2) branch of the immune system, which decreases ACE2-receptor expression (i.e., receptors SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect host cells), balances the inflammatory TH1/TH17 branches of the immune system triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reduces inflammation through the release of anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines. Because STHs are common and affect the most vulnerable and marginalized members of society, it is especially important to consider how these parasites may impact COVID-19 outcomes. Areas experiencing endemic STH infections are often characterized by a lack of preventative infrastructure and medical care, which may further exacerbate risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 development. For this reason, we also explore biocultural factors that contribute to disease outcomes for both SARS-CoV-2 and STH infections. Biocultural and Evolutionary Medicine perspectives on COVID-19 are crucial for understanding the global impact of the disease.\n\nLAY SUMMARY An evolutionary perspective is required to understand the global impact and various presentations of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs.

Due to the limited knowledge on the course of infection of this coronavirus and the lack of an effective treatment for this fatal disease, mortality remains high. The emergence of a cytokine storm in patients with a severe condition has been reported as the top reason of the death of patients with COVID-19 infection. However, the causative mechanism of cytokine storm remains elusive. Thus, we aim to observe the association of coagulopathy (D-dimer) with cytokine (i.e., IL-6) and CT imaging in COVID-19-infected patients.\nMethods: In this retrospective observational study, we systematically analyzed the comprehensive clinical laboratory data of COVID-19-positive patients in different illness groups of mild, moderate, and severe conditions according to the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition). T tests and chi-square tests were used for two-group comparisons. One-way ANOVA was used for three-group comparisons. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients of the D-dimer level with IL-6 and CT imaging were computed at baseline. With regular liquid biopsy approach, D-dimer, IL-6, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were recorded repeatedly with a time curve to investigate disease progression, along with CT imaging, and other indicators.\nResults: All the 64 patients were clinically evaluated and classified into three groups of mild (32 cases), moderate (23 cases), and severe (nine cases) conditions. The D-dimer level positively correlated with IL-6 (R = 0.5) at baseline when the COVID-19-infected patients were admitted. In addition, we observed that D-dimer rises earlier than the cytokine storm represented by IL-6 surge, which suggests that coagulopathy might act as a trigger to potentiate a cytokine storm.\nConclusion: Integrated analysis revealed a positive correlation of coagulopathy with cytokine storm in COVID-19-infected patients; the D-dimer rises early, which indicates that coagulopathy acts as a prodrome of cytokine storm.

Two members of this family, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are indispensable, since SOCS1 knockout in mice results in neonatal death due to interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) induced inflammatory disease, and SOCS3 knockout leads to embryonic lethality. We have shown that SOCS1 and SOCS3 (SOCS1/3) function as virus induced intrinsic virulence factors for influenza A virus, EMC virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and vaccinia virus infections. Other viruses such as pathogenic pig enteric coronavirus and coronavirus induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein also induce SOCS virus intrinsic virulence factors. SOCS1/3 exert their viral virulence effect via inhibition of type I and type II interferon (IFN) function. Specifically, the SOCS bind to the activation loop of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2 through the SOCS kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits STAT transcription factor activation by the kinases. Activated STATs are required for IFN function. We have developed a small peptide antagonist of SOCS1/3 that blocks SOCS1/3 inhibitory activity and prevents virus pathogenesis. The antagonist, pJAK2(1001-1013), is comprised of the JAK2 activation loop, phosphorylated at tyrosine 1007 with a palmitate for cell penetration. The remarkable thing about SOCS1/3 is that it serves as a broad, simple tool of perhaps most pathogenic viruses to avoid innate host IFN defense.

ACE2 exerts antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects and reduces lung inflammation. ACE2 is subjected to extensive transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation by epigenetic mechanisms and microRNAs. Also, ACE2 expression is regulated post-translationally by glycosylation, phosphorylation, and shedding from the plasma membrane. ACE2 protein is ubiquitous across mammalian tissues, prominently in the cardiovascular system, kidney, and intestine. ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract is of particular interest, in light of the discovery that ACE2 serves as the initial cellular target of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2, responsible of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an intense effort has been made to elucidate the biochemical determinants of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 interaction. It has been determined that SARS-CoV2 engages with ACE2 through its spike (S) protein, which consists of two subunits: S1, that mediates binding to the host receptor; S2, that induces fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and delivery of the viral genome. Owing to the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV2 pathogenicity, it has been speculated that medical conditions, i.e., hypertension, and/or drugs, i.e., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, known to influence ACE2 density could alter the fate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The debate is still open and will only be solved when results of properly designed experimental and clinical investigations will be made public. An interesting observation is, however that, upon infection, ACE2 activity is reduced either by downregulation or by shedding. These events might precipitate the so-called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that characterizes the most severe COVID-19 forms. As evidence accumulates, ACE2 appears a druggable target in the attempt to limit virus entry and replication. Strategies aimed at blocking ACE2 with antibodies, small molecules or peptides, or at neutralizing the virus by competitive binding with exogenously administered ACE2, are currently under investigations.

We hypothesize that certain miRNAs could simultaneously target multiple genes, are significantly conserved across many species, thereby demonstrating the potential to serve as diagnostic or therapeutic tools for bovine coronavirus infection. To this end, we utilized different existing and publicly available computational tools to conduct system analysis predicting important miRNAs that could affect BCoV pathogenesis. Eleven genes including CEBPD, IRF1, TLR9, SRC, and RHOA, significantly indicated in immune-related pathways, were identified to be associated with BCoV, and implicated in other coronaviruses. Of the 70 miRNAs predicted to target the identified genes, four concomitant miRNAs (bta-miR-11975, bta-miR-11976, bta-miR-22-3p, and bta-miR-2325c) were found.

Functional annotation and associated pathways of target genes, such as positive regulation of cytokine production, IL-6 signaling pathway, and regulation of leukocyte differentiation, indicate the miRNAs are major participants in multiple aspects of both innate and adaptive immune response.

We assessed the growth data for statistical improvements over no cytokine supplementation and used a systems biology approach to identify genes with the highest magnitude of expression change from control at several time points. Further, we developed a predictive mathematical model to project the growth rate for various cytokine combinations, and investigate genes and reactions regulated by cytokines in activated CD4+ T cells. The most favorable conditions from the T cell growth study and from the predictive model align to include the full range of IL-2 and IL-7 studied, and at lower levels of IL-15 (6 ng/mL or 36 ng/mL).

Intriguingly, HIV-1-induced ERVs harboring transcription start sites are primarily found in the vicinity of immunity genes. For example, HIV-1 infection activates LTR12C elements upstream of the interferon-inducible genes GBP2 and GBP5 that encode for broad-spectrum antiviral factors. Reporter assays demonstrated that these LTR12C elements drive gene expression in primary CD4+ T cells. In line with this, HIV-1 infection triggered the expression of a unique GBP2 transcript variant by activating a cryptic transcription start site within LTR12C. Furthermore, stimulation with HIV-1-induced cytokines increased GBP2 and GBP5 expression in human cells, but not in macaque cells that naturally lack the GBP5 gene and the LTR12C element upstream of GBP2. Finally, our findings suggest that GBP2 and GBP5 have already been active against ancient viral pathogens as they suppress the maturation of the extinct retrovirus HERV-K (HML-2).

Neutrophil function is modulated by numerous factors, including integrin activation, inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. Hypoxia has an important role in inflammation and may also contribute to pulmonary disease. We aimed to determine how neutrophil activation occurs in ILD and the relative importance of hypoxia. Using lung biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from ILD patients we investigated the extent of hypoxia and neutrophil activation in ILD lungs. Then we used ex vivo neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers and BAL from patients with ILD and non-ILD controls to further investigate aberrant neutrophil activation in hypoxia and ILD. We demonstrate for the first time using intracellular staining, HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization in neutrophils and endothelial cells in ILD lung biopsies. Hypoxia enhanced both spontaneous (+1.31-fold, p < 0.05) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced (+1.65-fold, p < 0.001) neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, neutrophil adhesion (+8.8-fold, <0.05), and trans-endothelial migration (+1.9-fold, p < 0.05).

Early clinical trials in the mid-1990's showed that systemic delivery of IL-12 incurred dose-limiting toxicities. Nevertheless, IL-12's pleiotropic activity, i.e., its ability to engage multiple effector mechanisms and reverse tumor-induced immunosuppression, continues to entice cancer researchers. The development of strategies which maximize IL-12 delivery to the tumor microenvironment while minimizing systemic exposure are of increasing interest. Diverse IL-12 delivery systems, from immunocytokine fusions to polymeric nanoparticles, have demonstrated robust antitumor immunity with reduced adverse events in preclinical studies.

Dysregulation of IL-22 production has also frequently been observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have previously described that human CD28, a crucial co-stimulatory receptor necessary for full T cell activation, is also able to act as a TCR independent signaling receptor and to induce the expression of IL-17A and inflammatory cytokines related to Th17 cells, which together with Th22 cells represent the main cellular source of IL-22. Here we characterized the role of CD28 autonomous signaling in regulating IL-22 expression in human CD4+ T cells. We show that CD28 stimulation in the absence of TCR strongly up-regulates IL-22 gene expression and secretion. As recently observed for IL-17A, we also found that CD28-mediated regulation of IL-22 transcription requires the cooperative activities of both IL-6-activated STAT3 and RelA/NF-\u03baB transcription factors. CD28-mediated IL-22 production also promotes the barrier functions of epithelial cells by inducing mucin and metalloproteases expression.

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness and 10-20% of infected individuals develop severe disease with interstitial pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this subgroup of patients, severe clinical manifestations are postulated to result from a hyperactive immune response. This has led to the proposal that immunomodulatory medications could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report a case of COVID-19 that was treated with the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab.\nA 54-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented to A&E with a one-week history of fever, cough, headache and ageusia. Her past medical history was significant for asthma, chronic headaches, gastro-oesophageal reflux syndrome and subarachnoid haemorrhage. On presentation, she had a low-grade temperature (37.8\u2009\u00b0C) but her observations were otherwise normal, and her oxygen saturations were 99% on room air. Examination revealed right basal chest crackles. Bloods showed a mild lymphopenia (0.9x109/l) and a raised CRP (82mg/l) and a chest radiograph demonstrated bibasal shadowing. The patient was diagnosed with probable COVID-19 and discharged with a course of oral doxycycline and a plan for review in the ambulatory unit the following day. When reviewed the next day, her oxygen saturations had fallen to 90% on room air. At this point, her SARS-CoV-2 assay had been resulted as positive and a decision was made to admit her for oxygen therapy.\nThe patient continued to deteriorate despite optimal supportive therapy and the addition of intravenous benzylpenicillin for possible superadded bacterial infection. On day 7 of admission, her respiratory rate was 32-38 breaths per minute, and she required 13l/min of oxygen. Her bloods revealed CRP 474mg/L, D dimer >6000\u2009ng/ml, ferritin 224\u2009\u03bcg/L, neutrophils 9.5x109/l\u00a0and lymphocytes 0.6 x109/l. There were no signs of superadded bacterial infection despite a thorough infection screen. Given her clinical deterioration, she was reviewed by the critical care team for consideration of transfer to higher-level care. The ward team decided to administer a single dose of the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab for the treatment of a cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19 infection.\u00a0\nWithin 24\u2009hours of tocilizumab treatment, her oxygen requirements fell to 5l/min and her work of breathing significantly improved. On day 15 of admission, she was discharged with saturations of 92% on room air.\u00a0\nThe patient described in this case showed significant clinical deterioration with features suggestive of cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19. IL-6 is thought to be a key cytokine responsible for initiating the acute phase response and we postulate that IL-6 levels were raised in this patient. Unfortunately, we did not have the assay available to measure this. The treating clinical team decided to prescribe a single dose of tocilizumab on a compassionate use basis. This resulted in a rapid clinical improvement and the patient was subsequently discharged without the need for intensive care. In this case, we propose that tocilizumab inhibited further cytokine activation and prevented the positive feedback loop of inflammation that can otherwise result in rapid clinical deterioration.\nThere are several interesting points to be noted from this case. In this patient, tocilizumab resulted in a rapid reduction in CRP levels. This is thought to correspond to the inhibition of IL-6 mediated release of acute phase proteins by the liver. Therefore, it should be noted that post-tocilizumab treatment, patients should be closely monitored for superadded bacterial infection as they may not mount a full immune response.\nLarger trials of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently underway and are required to confirm the efficacy of IL-6 inhibition for COVID-19. The phase III COVACTA trial of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status however a trend towards shorter hospital admissions was seen. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the role of tocilizumab in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral medication. Further information is required to determine which patients should receive immunomodulatory medications and at which point in their illness. Data is also needed to understand the most efficacious dosing regimen for tocilizumab and its side-effect profile in COVID-19 patients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and has led to an unprecedented effort from the scientific community to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to find effective treatments. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can induce a hyperactive immune response in a subgroup of patients who develop highly elevated levels of acute phase proteins. It has been proposed that the overactive immune response is responsible for some of the severe clinical manifestations seen and this has led to the suggestion that immunomodulatory medications could be used for the treatment of COVID-19.\nIndeed, dexamethasone has been shown to be an effective treatment and other immunomodulatory medications including hydroxychloroquine, the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra and JAK-kinase inhibitors are currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19. This case highlights the clinical and biochemical features of a patient who developed features suggestive of a cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19 and who responded to treatment with the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab.

Patients with chronic inflammatory disease on biological immunosuppressive treatments may be at a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. However, it is yet to be determined whether immunomodulatory medications used in inflammatory diseases have protective capabilities against severe outcomes.\nA 51-year old female with a 13-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presented to hospital with fever, exertional breathlessness, and a non-productive cough. She was diagnosed with seropositive erosive RA at the age of 38 and was on 6-monthly Rituximab infusions and Leflunomide on admission. She had relatively stable pulmonary fibrosis (diagnosed in 2010). Her chest CTs in 2010 and 2018 noted bilateral basal subpleural ground glass change with limited honeycombing and spirometry study revealed FEV1 of 2.2 (82% predicted), VC of 2.7 (87% predicted), DLCO of 7.0 (78% predicted) and kCO of 1.6 (78% predicted).\nOn admission in March 2020, she was hypoxic (oxygen saturation of 88% in room air) and had raised inflammatory markers (CRP 341mg/dL, d-Dimer 914ng/ml, Ferritin 3141ng/ml, LDH 672U/L). Her last Rituximab infusion was 3 months prior and leflunomide was withheld on admission. SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab was positive, and she was recruited to the RECOVERY trial, being randomized to Lopinavir-Ritonavir for 10 days. Her oxygen requirements increased, and a CT pulmonary angiogram excluded pulmonary embolism but revealed ground glass changes and extensive multilobar consolidation. She was eligible for recruitment into RECOVERY-2 (tocilizumab) given the ongoing oxygen requirement and elevated CRP, but she was randomised to usual care. She was commenced on 80mg of IV methylprednisolone, a dose chosen because of its proven effectiveness in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. She clinically improved and was discharged from hospital 20 days after starting Methylprednisolone with a CRP of 17mg/dL.\nTwo months after discharge, the patient had repeat spirometry study which noted FEV1 of 1.4 (57% predicted), VC of 1.5 (52% predicted), DLCO of 2.4 (28% predicted) and kCO of 1.0 (47% predicted). A repeat high-resolution chest CT reported significant improvement of peripheral ground glass changes and consolidation, but she is still fatigued and more breathless than previously.\nThe RECOVERY trial concluded that Dexamethasone reduced mortality in intubated patients and in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with a high oxygen requirement. The results were published after this patient was discharged.\nA hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is seen in a subset of patients, and our own hospital data suggest that this condition affects around 5% of admitted COVID-19 patients, but that extreme hyperferritinaemia above 10,000 is extremely rare. Similar responses (known as Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) are seen with a variety of viral and bacterial infections, in malignancy and in inflammatory rheumatic diseases (Macrophage Activation Syndrome [MAS]), but typically HLH and MAS patients have ferritin > 10,000.\nIt appears unlikely that true HLH is a significant manifestation of COVID-19 infection, but moderate hyperferritinaemia is not uncommon and the results of this study, taken together with case reports and series from China and Italy suggest that similar treatments to those used in HLH may transform the prognosis for COVID-19 patients in this subset. \nIt is unknown whether the recent Rituximab infusion had a role in reducing the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and delaying progression to severe COVID-19. However, it may be argued that the remaining T cells in B cell depleted patients are sufficient for viral clearance.\nThe long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary function is still unclear. Our patient had a major deterioration in her lung function when compared to her baseline. There was severe reduction in gas transfer post COVID-19. However, her repeat high resolution CT chest reported substantial improvement in ground glass changes and consolidation. The long-term prognosis is still uncertain.\nInitial fears that patients on DMARDs and biological therapies for inflammatory rheumatic disease would be extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 have not been confirmed, but patients with extra-articular manifestations on combinations of DMARDs and biological therapies may be a subset at higher risk. \nOur Intensivist colleagues, early in the COVID-19 outbreak, were understandably cautious about using heavily immunosuppressive treatments for a life-threatening viral infection. Using a multi-disciplinary approach at a time when knowledge of how to treat this condition was rudimentary, along with informed consent from an intelligent and thoughtful patient, we were able to plot a middle path to suppress hyperinflammation without using massively immunosuppressive doses of steroid, with a successful outcome. \nThis patient illustrates one aspect of the hyper-inflammatory response seen in a subset of the most critically ill patients with COVID-19. At the time of writing, the RECOVERY 2 trial is yet to be published, but the rapid improvement in inflammatory markers including CRP and Ferritin, along with a dramatic improvement in clinical state, suggest that relatively modest doses of parenteral steroid have life-saving potential at far lower cost and greater worldwide availability than biological therapies such as Tocilizumab or Anakinra. \nTrials of Tocilizumab in RECOVERY2 and of Anakinra coordinated by the Hyperinflammation Histio UK Haemophagocytosis Across Specialty Collaboration (HASC), as well as international randomised controlled trials will be critical in determining the optimal treatment strategy for this subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Her COVID-19 infection confirmed on PCR serology, has been protracted but non-fulminant. She did not require mechanical respiratory support. At the same time her GPA remained active and worsened requiring further immunosuppression after she developed mild pulmonary haemorrhage. She is currently still receiving vasculitis treatment.\nA 26-year-old lady with a background history of obstructive sleep apnoea and fibromyalgia was diagnosed with ENT-limited GPA in 2017. She was initially treated with azathioprine then methotrexate, and later switched to Rituximab in 2018 after she developed organ-threatening manifestations with bilateral hearing loss. She was stable on periodic infusions of rituximab at 6 to 9-monthly intervals and did not develop other organ-threatening features.\nShe had been given one dose of rituximab for a flare of her GPA. In between rituximab doses, she was admitted with acute COVID-19 infection with related pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, fluids, and oxygen. Shortly after discharge, she was readmitted with worsening symptoms of non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonia which was evident on chest x-ray and levofloxacin treatment was initiated. Her condition improved and she was discharged. No mechanical respiratory support was required. She had her 2nd dose of rituximab after it had been delayed by about 2 weeks. She had been afebrile after the acute COVID-19 infection and her persistent positive results were explained as related viral shedding over a period of 8 weeks.\nOne week later, she represented to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath, and her blood results showed a remarkable rise in inflammatory markers, including a CRP of 242. She was treated for non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonitis with worsening chest x-ray features. After hospital discharge, her GPA continued to flare with persistent epistaxis with nasal crusting. She also had worsening inflammatory arthritis with purpuric rash on her legs. An ENT review confirmed nasal septum perforation, but no renal involvement was found. Additional cyclophosphamide was commenced via the day-case unit. Her SARS-CoV-2 serology was negative prior to commencing cyclophosphamide. She is now SARS-CoV-2 positive after two doses of cyclophosphamide, but she is afebrile and stable.\nCOVID-19 infection carries a high mortality rate in patients with multiple co-morbidities, but recent literature suggests that patients on immunosuppressants may not actually have fulminant COVID-19 disease. This case illustrates the challenges of treating active vasculitis in the context of ongoing COVID-19 infection. Her vasculitis remained active requiring escalation of immunosuppression with caution, while she was concomitantly fighting SARS-CoV-2 and superadded bacterial infection. A similar case has been published by Guilpain et al of a 52-year-old woman with PR3-ANCA vasculitis on maintenance therapy with rituximab and low-dose prednisone who developed COVID-19 infection. They reported milder evolution of COVID-19 infection in comparison with previous reports.\nIt is now well known that some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine and tofacitinib could suppress the cytokine profile seen in severe COVID-19 infection. In addition, several case reports have even reported possible protective effect of immunosuppressants against severe complications of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatological and non-rheumatological conditions. Another complexity in this case was monitoring the disease progression, since both COVID-19 and GPA can have similar findings on chest CT scan of ground glass opacity.

There have been isolated reports of adults developing PIMS-TS, a rare inflammatory multisystem syndrome seen in children with COVID-19 which shares common features with Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome / sHLH.

A 3-day flu-like illness occurred 8 weeks earlier. Persistent pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension required ICU admission for inotropic support. Although she briefly required oxygen, hypoxaemia was not a prominent feature. Bloods revealed CRP>200mg/L, ferritin>14,000ng/mL, raised D-Dimer, procalcitonin, Troponin-T and ALT, anaemia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. Computed-tomography showed mild bibasilar subpleural ground-glass changes, pelvic free fluid, and peritoneal enhancement.\u00a0\nAs treatment for suspected COV-HLH, or connective tissue disorder, intra-venous hydrocortisone 100mg QDS was given; fever resolved and blood parameters transiently improved. Second nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive and screen for other infection and autoimmune disease negative. Echocardiography and CTA excluded coronary aneurysms although Troponin-T peak was 330ng/L.\nRapidly rising ferritin and triglycerides, falling cell counts and fibrinogen, led to a diagnosis of COV-HLH. Intra-venous anakinra 70mg (1mg/kg) BD was initiated. When pyrexia remained >40\u2009\u00b0C, inotrope requirement persisted, cell counts fell and ferritin rose to 45,861ng/ml, anakinra was increased over 48h to 200mg BD with intra-venous methylprednisolone 1g OD x2. After 7 days anakinra was weaned to 100mg subcutaneous BD enabling discharge. Outpatient bone marrow aspirate/trephine showed reactive hyperplasia, no leukaemia or haemophagocytosis. Genomic testing showed no primary genetic cause. A week later she was readmitted with fatigue, arthralgia, pyrexia, tachycardia, haematuria, and ferritin of 23,000ng/mL (nadir 4,000ng/mL). FDG-PET showed hepatosplenomegaly with no lymphoma. Anakinra was increased to 200mg IV BD with IVIG 1mg/kg OD x2 and methylprednisolone 1g IV OD x3, then cyclosporine 1mg/kg IV BD. Fevers and haemoproteinuria resolved within 1 week and inflammatory markers fell allowing discharge on a reducing regime of subcutaneous anakinra, oral prednisolone and cyclosporine.

Hence, we actively excluded coronary artery aneurysms, a key feature of the Kawasaki-type variant of PIMS-TS.\nInitial COVID-19 swabs were negative as was extensive investigation for other sepsis triggers. A high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 led to the second positive swab and early recognition of sHLH. Diagnosis of HLH can be challenging due to its non-specific features and was even more difficult in critically ill patients during the peak of the pandemic, where bone marrow biopsy and cross-sectional imaging (key components of diagnostic scoring systems such as the HScore) were difficult to obtain. Persistent pyrexia, hyperferritinaemia and recognition of worsening trends in all relevant domains raised suspicion of sHLH. On initiation of anakinra, her HScore was only 118, although her illness peak was 162, well above the HASC agreed threshold of 132 for HLH diagnosis during the pandemic. She subsequently had a negative bone marrow biopsy in line with >50% of critical care patients with sHLH; a demonstration that biopsy proven haemophagocytosis is not necessary for a clinical diagnosis of sHLH. No other sHLH trigger was found.\nEarly recognition and intensive treatment may have contributed to the positive outcome; sHLH mortality in ICU patients can reach nearly 70%. These decisions were facilitated by early discussion with MDT members of HASC. The initial dose of 70mg IV BD and speed of wean after an effective dose was achieved were insufficient. A longer period on 400mg anakinra daily, a slower wean, plus addition of methylprednisolone, IVIG and cyclosporin appeared to aid the resolution of her relapse.\u00a0\n\nCase report - Key learning points\n\u00a0COVID-19 infection is complicated by hyperinflammatory syndromes (cytokine storm, PIMS-TS, sHLH) in a significant minority of patients.

Whilst its use in sHLH remains off-license, UK guidelines have been developed, with an emphasis on early and high dose treatment. Careful anakinra weaning regimens should be considered and patient progress regularly reviewed to avoid relapse of sHLH and subsequent readmission.

Potent PARP 1 inhibitors are undergoing trials in cancer, but a readily available inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAM), which possesses a highly desirable biochemical and activity profile, merits exploration.

It was speculated that in subgroups of patients secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with features of macrophage activation syndrome might drive severe disease trajectories. If confirmed, profound immunosuppressive therapy would be a rationale treatment approach. Over a median observation period of 11 (IQR: 8; 16) days, 19 consecutive confirmed severe COVID-19-patients admitted to our intensive-care-unit were tested for presence of sHLH by two independent experts.

The median HScore at admission was 157 (IQR: 98;180), without the key clinical triad of HLH, i.e. progressive cytopenia, persistent fever and organomegaly. Independent expert chart review revealed the absence of sHLH in all cases. No patient reached more than 3/6 of modified HLH 2004 criteria.

The flavonoid polyphenol luteolin (LU) has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetes activities, but its effects regarding retinal protection remain unknown. Here, we examined the ability of luteolin to alleviate markers of inflammation related to RD in cytokine-primed APPE-19 cells. We found that luteolin decreased the levels of interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and attenuated adherence of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to IL-1\u03b2-stimulated ARPE-19 cells.

Many studies have shown that it can also play a role in the control of innate immunity by preventing exacerbated inflammation and its harmful effects toward the host. The arms race between hosts and pathogens has led some viruses to evolve strategies that enable them to benefit from autophagy, either by directly hijacking the autophagy pathway for their life cycle, or by using its regulatory functions in innate immunity. The control of viral replication and spread involves the production of anti-viral cytokines. Controlling the signals that lead to production of these cytokines is a perfect way for viruses to escape from innate immune responses and establish successful infection.

With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals.

Among these new drugs, we focussed on thioredoxin (Trx). Trx effectively prevents the progression of COPD by regulating redox status and protease/anti-protease balance, blocking the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signalling pathways, suppressing the activation and migration of inflammatory cells and the production of cytokines, inhibiting the synthesis and the activation of adhesion factors and growth factors, and controlling the cAMP-PKA and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways. The mechanism by which Trx affects COPD is different from glucocorticoid-based mechanisms which regulate the inflammatory reaction in association with suppressing immune responses.

Various commonly used clinical adjuvants, such as aluminium salts, saponins or emulsions, have been identified as activators of inflammasomes - multiprotein signalling platforms that drive activation of inflammatory caspases, resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family. Importantly, these cytokines affect the cellular and humoral arms of adaptive immunity, which indicates that inflammasomes represent a valuable target of vaccine adjuvants. In this review, we highlight the impact of different inflammasomes on vaccine adjuvant-induced immune responses regarding their mechanisms and immunogenicity. In this context, we focus on clinically relevant adjuvants that have been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and also present various experimental adjuvants that activate the NLRP3-, NLRC4-, AIM2-, pyrin-, or non-canonical inflammasomes and could have the potential to improve future vaccines.

At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells\u2014principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells\u2014which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity.

Regardless of asthma severity and adequate disease management, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control, often triggered by respiratory infections. The interferon (IFN) family represents a group of cytokines that play a central role in the protection against and exacerbation of various infections and pathologies, including asthma.

Similar pathogenesis is observed with the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibody-dependent enhancement has been reported for different coronaviruses. This phenomenon happens due to a decrease in the binding strength of neutralizing antibodies to the virus, which converts these antibodies into suboptimal\u2014not neutralizing ones. According to our hypothesis, such a decrease in affinity may be associated with a change in the conformation of the viral S-protein.

Endothelial cells are exposed to high levels of the cholesterol oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and this process is thought to mediate pathological inflammation. 7KC induces a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and an increase in apoptosis and necrosis in the endothelial cells. A relocalization of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, towards the nucleus of the cells was also observed. These effects were significantly attenuated by ET. In addition, 7KC induces marked increases in the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), as well as COX2 enzymatic activity, and these were significantly reduced by ET. Moreover, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ET were significantly reduced by co-incubation with an inhibitor of the ET transporter, OCTN1 (VHCL).

Inhibition of Gal-3 reduces the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 from macrophages\nin vitro, and as such may hold promise in reducing the incidence of CSS. In addition, Gal-3 inhibition shows promise in reducing transforming growth factor \u00df (TGF-\u00df) mediated pulmonary fibrosis, likely to be a major consequence in survivors of severe COVID-19. Finally, a key domain in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 has been shown to bind\nN-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a process that may be essential to cell entry by the virus. This Neu5Ac-binding domain shares striking morphological, sequence, and functional similarities with human Gal-3.

Innate immune system overactivity, termed the cytokine storm, appears to be critical in the development of the worst consequences of COVID-19 infection. Pathophysiology suggests that viral stimulation of the innate immune system, augmented by inflammatory signals sent from dying cells, ramps up into a poorly controlled outpouring of inflammatory mediators. Other aging-related changes in cells such as senescence as well as higher prevalence of chronic disease states also likely ramp up inflammatory signaling.

These viral components induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dysfunction and compensatory hyperactivation of STAT3. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, a positive feedback loop established between STAT3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may lead to an escalating cycle of activation in common with the interdependent signaling networks affected in COVID-19. Specifically, PAI-1 upregulation leads to coagulopathy characterized by intravascular thrombi. Overproduced PAI-1 binds to TLR4 on macrophages, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The recruitment and subsequent activation of innate immune cells within an infected lung drives the destruction of lung architecture, which leads to the infection of regional endothelial cells and produces a hypoxic environment that further stimulates PAI-1 production.

This release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines is underpinning lung tissue damage, respiratory failure, and eventually multiple organ failure in COVID-19 patients. The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 is positively correlated with virus load and ERK1/2 inhibition suppressed viral replication and viral infectivity. Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2, or damping hyperinflammatory cytokines storm, blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation have a great potential to inhibit viral entry along with viral infectivity. Herein, we report that the FDA-approved non-peptide opioid antagonist drug, naltrexone suppresses high fat/LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release both from macrophage cells and Adipose Tissue Macrophage. Moreover, Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) also showed its activity as an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Notably, virtual docking and simulation data also suggest LDN may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD. LDN may be considered as a target as the treatment and (or) adjuvant therapy for coronavirus infection. Clinical toxicity measurements may not be required for LDN since naltrexone was previously tested and is an approved drug by the FDA.\nCommunicated by Ramaswamy H.

Hence, the situation demands an urgent need to explore all potential therapeutic strategies that can be made available to prevent the disease progression and improve patient outcomes. In absence of clinically proven treatment guidelines, several repurposed drugs and investigational agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their probable benefits in the treatment of COVID-19. These include antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, and favipiravir), interferon, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiparasitic drugs (ivermectin and nitazoxanide), biologics (monoclonal antibodies and interleukin receptor antagonist), cellular therapies (mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells), convalescent plasma, and cytokine adsorber.

This acute pandemic has spread from the East and has been overlaid onto a slow pandemic of metabolic diseases of obesity and diabetes consequent from the increasing adoption of a Western-lifestyle characterized by excess calorie consumption with limited physical activity. It has become clear that these conditions predispose individuals to a more severe COVID-19 with increased morbidity and mortality. There are many features of diabetes and obesity that may accentuate the clinical response to SARS-CoV-2 infection: including an impaired immune response, an atherothrombotic state, accumulation of advanced glycation end products and a chronic inflammatory state. These could prime an exaggerated cytokine response to viral infection, predisposing to the cytokine storm that triggers progression to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Infection leads to an inflammatory response and tissue damage resulting in increased metabolic activity and an associated increase in the mechanisms by which cells ingest and degrade tissue debris and foreign materials. It is becoming clear that viruses have acquired an ability to exploit these mechanisms to invade cells and facilitate their own life-cycle.

Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes.

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-\u0263 and monocyte TFN-\u03b1 production.

Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%\u201350% of the IFN-\u0263 and TNF-\u03b1 observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from sepsis ultimately leads to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and subsequently increased vascular leakage. Current fluid resuscitation techniques only transiently improve outcomes in sepsis, and can cause edema. Nitric oxide (NO) treatment for sepsis has shown promise in the past, but implementation is difficult due to the challenges associated with delivery and the transient nature of NO. To address this, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacy of sustained delivery of exogenous NO using i.v. infused NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-np). The impact of NO-np on microhemodynamics and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model was evaluated. NO-np treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory response by promoting M2 macrophage repolarization, which reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and slowed vascular extravasation. Combined, this resulted in significantly improved microvascular blood flow and 72-h survival of animals treated with NO-np. The results from this study suggest that sustained supplementation of endogenous NO ameliorates and may prevent the morbidities of acute systemic inflammatory conditions.

The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19-induced lung cell damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of anti-inflammatory therapy (i.e., canakinumab 300\u2009mg subcutaneous) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. \n A prospective cohort study was conducted, started on March 25, 2020, for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy.

This is characterized at the molecular level by decreased energy metabolism, altered redox state, oxidative damage, and cell death. Therapies that increase levels of (R)-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-BHB), such as the ketogenic diet or consuming exogenous ketones, should restore altered energy metabolism and redox state. R-BHB activates anti-inflammatory GPR109A signaling and inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome and histone deacetylases, while a ketogenic diet has been shown to protect mice from influenza virus infection through a protective \u03b3\u03b4 T cell response and by increasing electron transport chain gene expression to restore energy metabolism. During a virus-induced cytokine storm, metabolic flexibility is compromised due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that damage, downregulate, or inactivate many enzymes of central metabolism including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This leads to an energy and redox crisis that decreases B and T cell proliferation and results in increased cytokine production and cell death. It is hypothesized that a moderately high-fat diet together with exogenous ketone supplementation at the first signs of respiratory distress will increase mitochondrial metabolism by bypassing the block at PDC. R-BHB-mediated restoration of nucleotide coenzyme ratios and redox state should decrease ROS and RNS to blunt the innate immune response and the associated cytokine storm, allowing the proliferation of cells responsible for adaptive immunity. Limitations of the proposed therapy include the following: it is unknown if human immune and lung cell functions are enhanced by ketosis, the risk of ketoacidosis must be assessed prior to initiating treatment, and permissive dietary fat and carbohydrate levels for exogenous ketones to boost immune function are not yet established. The third limitation could be addressed by studies with influenza-infected mice.

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the regulation of RLR-triggered effector functions of human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Our results show that RLR stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2 downstream targets p70S6 kinase and Akt, respectively, and this process was prevented by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin as well as the dual mTORC1/C2 kinase inhibitor AZD8055 in both DC subtypes. Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR in moDCs impaired the RLR stimulation-triggered glycolytic switch, which was reflected by the inhibition of lactate production and downregulation of key glycolytic genes. Blockade of mTOR diminished the ability of RLR-stimulated moDCs and pDCs to secret type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while it did not affect the phenotype of DCs. We also found that mTOR blockade decreased the phosphorylation of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which mediates RLR-driven cytokine production. In addition, rapamycin abrogated the ability of both DC subtypes to promote the proliferation and differentiation of IFN-y and Granzyme B producing CD8 + T cells. Interestingly, AZD8055 was much weaker in its ability to decrease the T cell proliferation capacity of DCs and was unable to inhibit the DC-triggered production of IFN-y and Granyzme B by CD8 + T cells. Here we demonstrated for the first time that mTOR positively regulates the RLR-mediated antiviral activity of human DCs. Further, we show that only selective inhibition of mTORC1 but not dual mTORC1/C2 blockade suppresses effectively the T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs that should be considered in the development of new generation mTOR inhibitors and in the improvement of DC-based vaccines."], "7500361": ["Jean Barr\u00e9, Jean-Marc Sabatier, C\u00e9dric Annweiler", "7500361", "Montelukast Drug May Improve COVID-19 Prognosis: A Review of Evidence", "With the lack of effective therapy, chemoprevention and vaccination, focusing on the immediate repurposing of existing drugs gives hope of curbing the pandemic.

Recently, neurologic alterations have been associated with hRSV infection in children, which include seizures, central apnea, and encephalopathy. Also, hRSV RNA has been detected in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with neurological symptoms after hRSV infection. Additionally, previous studies have shown that hRSV can be detected in the lungs and brains of mice exposed to the virus, yet the potential effects of hRSV infection within the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown. Here, using a murine model for hRSV infection, we show a significant behavior alteration in these animals, up to two months after the virus exposure, as shown in marble-burying tests. hRSV infection also produced the expression of cytokines within the brain, such as IL-4, IL-10, and CCL2. We found that hRSV infection alters the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) in mice, allowing the trespassing of macromolecules and leading to increased infiltration of immune cells into the CNS together with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Finally, we show that hRSV infects murine astrocytes both, in vitro and in vivo.

This seemingly anomalous result is what might be expected if GPX1 is a substrate for the active protease, leading to its fragmentation. We show that the GPX1 active site sequence is substantially similar to a known Mpro cleavage site, and is identified as a potential cysteine protease site by the Procleave algorithm. Proteolytic knockdown of GPX1 is highly consistent with previously documented effects of recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro in transfected cells, including increased reactive oxygen species and NF-\u03baB activation.

Deregulated complement activation may fuel cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby leading to multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) may elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we compare the efficacy of the C5-targeting monoclonal antibody eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, marked lung function improvement, and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID-19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, attenuated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, faster serum LDH decline, and more prominent lymphocyte recovery. These early clinical results offer important insights into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19 and point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways in thromboinflammation.

These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1/early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells.

Moreover, there is convincing preliminary evidence linking microbiota-gut-liver axis perturbations, proinflammatory status, and endothelial damage in noncommunicable preventable diseases with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) severity. Intestinal damage due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, systemic inflammation-induced dysfunction, and IL-6-mediated diffuse vascular damage may increase intestinal permeability and precipitate bacterial translocation.

Although the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are associated with respiratory or intestinal symptoms, reports of neurological signs and symptoms are increasing. The etiology of these neurological manifestations remains obscure, and probably involves several direct pathways, not excluding the direct entry of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory epithelium, circumventricular organs, or disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier. Furthermore, neuroinflammation might occur in response to the strong systemic cytokine storm described for COVID-19, or due to dysregulation of the CNS rennin-angiotensin system. Descriptions of neurological manifestations in patients in the previous coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks have been numerous for the SARS-CoV and lesser for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Strong evidence from patients and experimental models suggests that some human variants of CoV have the ability to reach the CNS and that neurons, astrocytes, and/or microglia can be target cells for CoV. A growing body of evidence shows that astrocytes and microglia have a major role in neuroinflammation, responding to local CNS inflammation and/or to disbalanced peripheral inflammation. This is another potential mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 damage to the CNS. In this comprehensive review, we will summarize the known neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; explore the potential role for astrocytes and microglia in the infection and neuroinflammation; and compare them with the previously described human and animal CoV that showed neurotropism to propose possible underlying mechanisms."], "7476329": ["Faisal Alsayegh, Shaker A.

CD147 is a glycoprotein that is responsible for the cytokine storm in the lungs through the mediation of viral invasion. Melatonin use previously was shown to reduce cardiac damage by blocking the CD147 activity. Hence, melatonin, a safe drug, may prevent severe symptoms, reduce symptom severity and the adverse effects of the other antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.

We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) inhibits ligand binding to the IL-6 receptor and may be a potential treatment for the hyperinflammation symptoms of COVID-19. However, data regarding the efficacy of TCZ in COVID-19 are lacking. The rapid spread of the pandemic in France, especially in the Paris region, constrained us to the off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe clinical conditions.\nA single-centre observational cohort study of 44 patients infected with COVID-19 was carried out between 6 April and 21 April 2020 in Groupe Hospitalier Intercommunal Le Raincy-Montfermeil (GHILRM). Twenty-two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were treated with TCZ and were compared with 22 patients not treated with TCZ matched for age, gender and length of hospital stay for COVID-19. Respiratory rate and oxygen supplementation as well as laboratory parameters (such as C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were collected at baseline and during 14 days of follow-up.

Therefore, the current study employed in silico tools to rationally identify new possible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. That is an enzyme conserved among the coronavirus species; hence, the identification of an Mpro inhibitor is to make it a broad-spectrum drug. Molecular docking studies described the binding sites and the interaction energies of 74 Mpro-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A structural similarity screening was carried out in order to identify possible Mpro ligands that show additional pharmacological properties against COVID-19. We identified 59 hit compounds and among them, melatonin stood out due to its prominent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; it can reduce oxidative stress, defence cell mobility and efficiently combat the cytokine storm and sepsis. In addition, melatonin is an inhibitor of calmodulin, an essential intracellular component to maintain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface. Interestingly, one of the most promising hits in our docking study was melatonin. It revealed better interaction energy with Mpro compared to ligands in complexes from PDB. Consequently, melatonin can have response potential in early stages for its possible effects on ACE-2 and Mpro, although it is also promising in more severe stages of the disease for its action against hyper-inflammation.

At present, scientists are exploring various approaches to curb this pandemic and alleviate its health consequences, while racing to develop a vaccine. A particularly insidious aspect of COVID-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. This unbridled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can directly or indirectly cause massive organ damage and failure. Systemic vascular endothelial inflammation and thrombocytopenia are potential consequences as well. In the case of COVID-19, the cytokine storm often fits the pattern of the macrophage activation syndrome with lymphocytopenia. The basis for the imbalance between the innate and adaptive immune systems is not clearly defined, but highlights the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages.

Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host.

TNF alpha reduces fluid absorption due to impairment of sodium and chloride transport required for building an osmotic gradient across epithelial cells, which in the airways maintains airway surface liquid helping to keep airways open and enabling bacterial clearance and aids water absorption from the alveolar spaces. TNF alpha can, through Rho-kinase, disintegrate the endothelial and epithelial cytoskeleton, and thus break up intercellular tight junctional proteins, breaching the intercellular barrier, which prevents flooding of the interstitial and alveolar spaces with fluid.\nHypotheses: (1) Preservation and restoration of airway and alveolar epithelial sodium and chloride transport and the cytoskeleton dependent integrity of the cell barriers within the lung can prevent and treat COVID 19 lung disease. (2) TNF alpha is the key mediator of pulmonary edema in COVID 19 lung disease.\nConfirmation of hypothesis and implications: The role of a reduction in the function of epithelial sodium and chloride transport could with regards to chloride transport be tested by analysis of chloride levels in exhaled breath condensate and levels correlated with TNF alpha concentrations. Reduced levels would indicate a reduction of the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and a correlation with TNF alpha levels indicative of its involvement. Anti-TNF alpha treatment with antibodies is already available and needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials of COVID 19 lung disease. TNF alpha levels could also be reduced by statins, aspirin, and curcumin. Chloride transport could be facilitated by CFTR activators, including curcumin and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Sodium and chloride transport could be further regulated to prevent accumulation of alveolar fluid by use of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(\u2212) cotransporter type 1 inhibitors, which have been associated with improved outcome in adults ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in randomized controlled trials.

The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Inflammatory cytokines modulate phenotype and function of all myocardial cells, suppressing contractile function in cardiomyocytes, inducing inflammatory activation in macrophages, stimulating microvascular inflammation and dysfunction, and promoting a matrix-degrading phenotype in fibroblasts. Moreover, cytokine-induced growth factor synthesis may exert chronic fibrogenic actions contributing to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In addition to their role in adverse cardiac remodeling, some inflammatory cytokines may also exert protective actions on cardiomyocytes under conditions of stress. Chemokines, such as CCL2, are also upregulated in failing hearts and may stimulate recruitment of pro-inflammatory leukocytes, promoting myocardial injury, fibrotic remodeling, and dysfunction. Although experimental evidence suggests that cytokine and chemokine targeting may hold therapeutic promise in heart failure, clinical translation remains challenging.

The resolution of inflammation is now appreciated to be an active biochemical process regulated by endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators which combat infections and stimulate tissue repair/regeneration. Environmental and chemical human carcinogens, including aflatoxins, asbestos, nitrosamines, alcohol, and tobacco, induce tumor-promoting inflammation and can disrupt the resolution of inflammation contributing to a devastating global cancer burden. While mechanisms of carcinogenesis have focused on genotoxic activity to induce mutations, nongenotoxic mechanisms such as inflammation and oxidative stress promote genotoxicity, proliferation, and mutations. Moreover, carcinogens initiate oxidative stress to synergize with inflammation and DNA damage to fuel a vicious feedback loop of cell death, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. In contrast, stimulation of resolution of inflammation may prevent carcinogenesis by clearance of cellular debris via macrophage phagocytosis and inhibition of an eicosanoid/cytokine storm of pro-inflammatory mediators.

Clinical improvement, defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale, was observed in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (P=.006). Similarly, the proportion of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen<315 mm Hg) was significantly reduced over time when treated with lenzilumab compared with untreated (P<.001). Significant improvement in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin 6) and markers of disease severity (absolute lymphocyte count) were observed in patients who received lenzilumab, but not in untreated patients. Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells 2 days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab.\nIn high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with faster improvement in clinical outcomes, including oxygenation, and greater reductions in inflammatory markers compared with a matched control cohort of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

The reason older patients and males show increased risk of severe disease and death remains uncertain. Sex hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, might be implicated in the age-dependent and sex-specific severity of COVID-19. High testosterone levels could upregulate transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), facilitating the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women.

However, research on asymptomatic viral infection is currently ongoing worldwide to elucidate the real prevalence and mortality of the disease.

Interestingly, the decrease of CD73 on CD8+ T cells and NKT cells correlated with serum ferritin levels. Furthermore, we observed distinct functional differences between the CD73+ and CD73- subsets of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells with regard to cytokine/toxin secretion.

Hence, in obese COVID-19 patients, some drugs might cause more severe (and/or more frequent) DILI, while others might trigger the transition of fatty liver to NASH, or worsen pre-existing steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. We also present the main mechanisms whereby drugs can be more hepatotoxic in MAFLD including impaired activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress.

In this way, it would be very important to investigate the pro-coagulative substrate both in all subjects who died and in COVID-19 survivors. This is because it may be hypothesized that the different patterns with which the pathology is expressed could depend on different individual susceptibility to infection or a different personal genetic-clinical background. In light of these findings, it would be important to perform more post-mortem investigations in order to clarify all aspects of the vascular hypothesis in the COVID-19 infection.

This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. \nStudy Participants and Methods\nWe investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg/day equivalent (0.01 ug/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. \nResults\nThe DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. \nDiscussion\nThe Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine.

As a new virus, not previously in the human population, but with similarities to other coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS/ARDS), and no known treatments, the race to re-purpose existing drugs and to enlist novel therapeutics is underway. In the half-year since the first cases, we have acquired substantial knowledge of this virus and the clinical course of COVID-19 progression. Results from early clinical trials have revealed two treatments (remdesivir, dexamethasone) that mitigate disease progression but clearly, there is much room for improvement. Initial case reports indicated many succumb to COVID-19 of hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS. However, ensuing studies revealed an atypical, immune cell-sequestered, vasculature-inflamed state leading to multiorgan thrombotic complications and end organ failure likely due to hyperinflammatory host responses. This Perspective focuses on a potential mechanism for a key COVID-19 disease progression turning point related to vascular and airway inflammation. The leukotriene lipid mediators have been overlooked with discussion centering on cytokine storms unleashing the deadly form of COVID-19. Leukotrienes possess some of the most potent known activities on immune cell trafficking and vascular leakage. We offer a simple treatment paradigm using two generic drugs targeting the hyperinflammatory response that characterizes the turning point from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 by targeting leukotriene biosynthesis with zileuton (Zyflo\u00ae controlled release formulation) and antagonism of the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor with montelukast (Singulair\u00ae)."], "7403492": ["Thyago M. de Queiroz, Navya Lakkappa, Eric Lazartigues", "7403492", "ADAM17-Mediated Shedding of Inflammatory Cytokines in Hypertension", "The increase of Angiontesin-II (Ang-II), one of the key peptides of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and its binding to the Ang-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) during hypertension is a crucial mechanism leading to AD\\AM17 activation.

Besides, the incomplete attenuation procedure involved in the production of modified live vaccines (MLV) may cause them to revert to the more virulence forms. TCMs have shown some promising potentials in bridging this gap. Several investigations have revealed that herbal extracts from TCMs contain molecules with significant antiviral activities against the various stages of the life cycle of PRRSV, and they do this through different mechanisms. They either block PRRSV attachment and entry into cells or inhibits the replication of viral RNA or viral particles assembly and release or act as immunomodulators and pathogenic pathway inhibitors through cytokines regulations. Here, we summarized the various antiviral strategies employed by some TCMs against the different stages of the life cycle of PRRSV under two major classes, including direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and indirect-acting antivirals (IAAs). We highlighted their mechanisms of action. In conclusion, we recommended that in making plans for the use of TCMs to control PRRSV, the pathway forward must be built on a real understanding of the mechanisms by which bioactive compounds exert their effects. This will provide a template that will guide the focus of collaborative studies among researchers in the areas of bioinformatics, chemistry, and proteomics.

Several reports from around the world have identified obesity and severe obesity as one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, countries with greater obesity prevalence have a higher morbidity and mortality risk of developing serious outcomes from COVID-19. The understanding of how this increased susceptibility of the people with obesity to develop severe forms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs is crucial for implementing appropriate public health and therapeutic strategies to avoid COVID-19 severe symptoms and complications in people living with obesity. We hypothesize here that increased ACE2 expression in adipose tissue displayed by people with obesity may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and accessibility to this tissue. Individuals with obesity have increased white adipose tissue, which may act as a reservoir for a more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification. Here we discuss how obesity is related to a pro-inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation, increased SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry in adipose tissue and induction of hypercoagulopathy, leading people with obesity to develop severe forms of COVID-19 and also death. Taken together, it may be crucial to better explore the role of visceral adipose tissue in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate the potential therapeutic effect of using specific target anti-inflammatories (canakinumab or anakinra for IL-1\u03b2 inhibition; anti-IL-6 antibodies for IL-6 inhibition), anticoagulant or anti-diabetic drugs in COVID-19 treatment of people with obesity.

Among critically ill patients, non-survivors (N\u00a0=\u00a0183) had a continuous increase in hs-cTnI levels during hospitalization, while survivors (N\u00a0=\u00a0293) showed a decrease in hs-cTnI level between day 4 and 7 after admission. Specifically, cardiac injury is an independent marker of mortality among critically ill patients at admission, day 4\u20137 and 8\u201314. Consistent positive correlations between hs-cTnI and interleukin (IL)-6 on admission (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59), day 4\u20137 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.66) and day 8\u201314 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.61; all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and d-dimer (at the same timepoints r\u00a0=\u00a00.54; 0.65; 0.61, all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were observed. A similar behavior was observed between hs-cTnI and most of other biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation.\nCardiac injury commonly occurs in critically ill COVID-19 patients, with increased levels of hs-cTnI beyond day 3 since admission portending a poor prognosis.

The disease seems to result from the interplay of genetic and environmental susceptibility factors with infectious triggers, followed by a subsequent abnormal immune response characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the acute phase. Evidence has mounted to suggest that an imbalance between T helper 17 cells (Th17s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is associated with aberrant immune responses in KD. Recent advances in culture-independent techniques for detection and identification of intestinal commensal bacteria enabled the discovery that Th17 and Treg differentiation are regulated by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in particular butyrate, produced by the gut microbiota. This finding provided a mechanistic link between dysbiosis, defined as changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and various inflammatory diseases. On this basis, we propose that dysbiosis, with reduced production of SCFAs leading to imbalances of Th17s/Tregs, could be involved in the etiology of KD. A pilot study supported this hypothesis, as only fecal concentrations of butyrate were significantly reduced in KD patients among SCFAs. This evolving perspective prompted us to undertake metagenomic analyses of bacterial DNA from the feces of KD patients who were antibiotic-na\u00efve at diagnosis.

However, it has not been clarified whether \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity causes different responses to early sepsis between male and female mice. In this study, sepsis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli (E. coli). The changes of inflammatory cytokines expression, and macrophage polarization in male, female, and ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice in sepsis model were investigated. For in vitro studies, different macrophages were treated with LPS. The function of estradiol (E2) on macrophage cell lines was verified and the mechanism of E2 affecting trained immunity was explored. We demonstrated that \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity was more resistant to sepsis in female than male mice. Macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype, which exhibited enhanced trained immunity, was related to the difference in sepsis resistance between female and male mice. Moreover, ovariectomized (OVX) mice manifested serious sepsis consequences with a weaker trained immunity effect than female mice. Female bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were also apt to be polarized to the M1 phenotype in response to trained immunity in vitro. Furthermore, E2 promoted trained immunity in macrophage cell lines J774 and RAW264.7. E2 was also verified to facilitate trained immunity in primary BMDMs from female and male mice.

Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed.

Diabetes, obesity, and hypertension have, as minor common denominators, chronic low-grade inflammation and high plasma myeloperoxidase levels, which could be linked to pulmonary phagocytic hyperactivation and CSS. The hyperactivation of M1 macrophages with a proinflammatory phenotype, which is linked to aerobic glycolysis, leads to the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets from circulating blood and plays a crucial role in thrombo-inflammation (as recently demonstrated in COVID-19) through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and monocyte-platelet aggregates, which could be responsible for DIC. The modulation of glucose availability for activated M1 macrophages by means of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) could represent a possible metabolic tool for reducing adenosine triphosphate production from aerobic glycolysis in the M1 macrophage phenotype during the exudative phase. This approach could reduce the overproduction of cytokines and, consequently, the accumulation of neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets from the blood. Second, an EKD could be advantageous for the metabolism of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages because these cells predominantly express oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and are best fed by the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. An EKD could guarantee the availability of free fatty acids, which are an optimal fuel supply for these cells. Third, an EKD, which could reduce high lactate formation by macrophages due to glycolysis, could favor the production of interferon type I, which are inhibited by excessive lactate production.

RP-832c selectively binds to CD206 on M2 polarized bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)\nin vitro\n, resulting in a time-dependent decrease in CD206 expression, and a transient increase in M1 marker TNF\u03b1, which resolves over a 24hr period. To elucidate the antifibrotic effect of RP-832c, we used a murine model of bleomycin (BLM) -induced early-stage pulmonary fibrosis. RP-832c significantly reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis in a dosage dependent manner, as well as decreased CD206, TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA expression in mouse lungs. Interestingly we did not observe any changes in the resident alveolar macrophage marker CD170 expression. Similarly, in an established model of lung fibrosis, RP-832c significantly decreased fibrosis in the lung, as well as significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, INF-\u03b3, CXCL1/2, and fibrosis markers TGF-\u03b21 and MMP-13. In comparison with FDA approved drugs, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, RP-832c exhibited a similar reduction in fibrosis compared to Pirfenidone, and to a greater extent than Nintedanib, with no apparent toxicities observed on body weight or blood chemistry.

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage.

Our current study compared five SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different geographical regions to those from SARS, MERS and two cold viruses, OC43 and 229E, to identify the presence of miR-like sequences. We identified seven key miRs, which highlight considerable differences between the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, compared with the other viruses. The level of conservation between the five SARS-CoV-2 sequences was identical but poor compared with the other sequences, with SARS showing the highest degree of conservation. This decrease in similarity could result in reduced levels of transcriptional control, as well as a change in the physiological effect of the virus and associated host-pathogen responses. MERS and the milder symptom viruses showed greater differences and even significant sequence gaps. This divergence away from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences broadly mirrors the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the whole-genome alignments. Therefore, patterns of mutation, occurring during sequence divergence from the longer established human viruses to the more recent ones, may have led to the emergence of sequence motifs that can be related directly to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host\u2019s receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines can be used. Phillyrin (KD-1), a representative ingredient of Forsythia suspensa, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antiviral activities. However, little is known about the antiviral abilities and mechanism of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E).\nThe study was designed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of KD-1 against the novel SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E and its potential effect in regulating host immune response in vitro.\nThe antiviral activities of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E were assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect and plaque-reduction assay. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.

The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed."], "7392080": ["Mika Okamoto, Masaaki Toyama, Masanori Baba", "7392080", "The chemokine receptor antagonist cenicriviroc inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro", "Cenicriviroc (CVC) is a small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonist with highly potent and selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity through antagonizing C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) as a coreceptor of HIV-1.

Little is known about gut inflammation in cirrhosis and how this differs in acute decompensation (AD). We developed a novel approach to characterise intestinal immunopathology by quantifying faecal cytokines (FCs) and GBI markers.\nFaeces and plasma were obtained from patients with stable cirrhosis (SC; n\u00a0= 16), AD (n\u00a0= 47), and healthy controls (HCs; n\u00a0= 31). A panel of 15 cytokines and GBI markers, including intestinal fatty-acid-binding protein-2 (FABP2), d-lactate, and faecal calprotectin (FCAL), were quantified by electrochemiluminescence/ELISA. Correlations between analytes and clinical metadata with univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nFaecal (F) IL-1\u03b2, interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor alpha, IL-21, IL-17A/F, and IL-22 were significantly elevated in AD vs. SC (q <0.01). F-IL-23 was significantly elevated in AD vs. HC (p\u00a0= 0.0007). FABP2/d-lactate were significantly increased in faeces in AD vs. SC and AD vs. HC (p <0.0001) and in plasma (p\u00a0= 0.0004; p\u00a0= 0.011). F-FABP2 correlated most strongly with disease severity (Spearman's rho: Child-Pugh 0.466; p <0.0001; model for end-stage liver disease 0.488; p <0.0001). FCAL correlated with plasma IL-21, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17F only and none of the faecal analytes. F-cytokines and F-GBI markers were more accurate than plasma in discriminating AD from SC.\nFC profiling represents an innovative approach to investigating the localised intestinal cytokine micro-environment in cirrhosis. These data reveal that AD is associated with a highly inflamed and permeable gut barrier. FC profiles are very different from the classical innate-like features of systemic inflammation. There is non-specific upregulation of TH1/TH17 effector cytokines and those known to mediate intestinal barrier damage. This prevents mucosal healing in AD and further propagates BT and systemic inflammation.\nThe gut barrier is crucial in cirrhosis in preventing infection-causing bacteria that normally live in the gut from accessing the liver and other organs via the bloodstream. Herein, we characterised gut inflammation by measuring different markers in stool samples from patients at different stages of cirrhosis and comparing this to healthy people. These markers, when compared with equivalent markers usually measured in blood, were found to be very different in pattern and absolute levels, suggesting that there is significant gut inflammation in cirrhosis related to different immune system pathways to that seen outside of the gut.

First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit the production of melatonin, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work.

It has been suggested that in viral pneumonia, virus itself is not a direct cause of acute lung injury; rather, aberrant immune reactions of the host to the insults from viral infection are responsible. According to its epidemiological and clinical characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 may be a virus with low virulence in nature that has adapted to the human species.

Patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 show more severe hypercytokinemia with corresponding lymphocytopenia than patients with mild pneumonia; thus, early immunomodulator treatment, including corticosteroids, has been considered. However, current guidelines recommend their use only for patients with advanced pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Recently, a predisposition for arterial and venous thromboses has been reported in COVID-19 infection.

The LPA gene contains an interleukin-6 (IL-6) response element that may induce an acute phase\u2013type increase in Lp(a) levels following a cytokine storm from COVID-19.\nThus, subjects with either baseline elevated Lp(a) or those who have an increase following COVID-19 infection, or both, may be at very high risk of developing thromboses. Elevated Lp(a) may also lead to acute destabilization of preexisting but quiescent atherosclerotic plaques, which might induce acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Ongoing studies with IL-6 antagonists may be informative in understanding this relationship, and registries are being initiated to measure Lp(a) in subjects infected with COVID-19. If indeed an association is suggestive of being causal, consideration can be given to systematic testing of Lp(a) and prophylactic systemic anticoagulation in infected inpatients.

End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

Vitamin D influences expression of many genes with well-established relevance to airway infections and relevant to immune system function. Recently, VDD has been shown to be a risk factor for acquisition and severity of COVID-19. Thus, treating VDD presents a safe and inexpensive opportunity for modulating the severity of the disease. VDD is common in those over 60 years of age, many with co-morbid conditions and in people with skin pigmentation sufficient to reduce synthesis of vitamin D. Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is also associated with worse outcomes from COVID19. Vitamin D stimulates transcription of cathelicidin which is cleaved to generate LL37. LL37 is an innate antimicrobial with demonstrated activity against a wide range of microbes including envelope viruses. LL37 also modulates cytokine signaling at the site of infections. Fine particles in air pollution can interfere with LL37 destruction of viruses and may reduce effective immune signaling modulation by LL37. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37.\nConclusion: Vitamin D plays an important role reducing the impact of viral lung disease processes. VDD is an acknowledged public health threat that warrants population-wide action to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37.

It is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly mutable coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this article, using well-known RNA viruses (HIV, influenza viruses, HCV) as examples, we consider the main successes and failures in creating primarily highly effective vaccines. The experience accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy. The most effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be those able to form highly effective memory cells for both humoral (memory B cells) and cellular (cross-reactive antiviral memory T cells) immunity. Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 'universal' vaccines based on conservative SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN), which can be effective for long periods of use. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a lasso-like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing CpG motifs and the antigen-presenting unique ACG-containing genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that CpG dinucleotides are the least rare dinucleotides in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, and hypothesized that their higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted increased lethality to the host, causing a \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 in people who overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific Toll-like receptors in a manner similar to TLR9-CpG ODN interactions. Interestingly, the virus strains sequenced in China (Wuhan) in February 2020 contained on average one CpG dinucleotide more in their genome than the later strains from the USA (New York) sequenced in May 2020. Obviously, during the first steps of the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, natural selection tends to select viral genomes containing fewer CpG motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response, so the infected person has moderate symptoms and spreads SARS-CoV-2 more readily.

Older age, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, D-dimer, Procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein levels, decreased albumin, elevated serum cytokines (IL2R, IL6, IL8, IL10, and TNF-\u03b1) levels, and a decreased lymphocyte count indicated poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subset (lymphocytes, T cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, natural killer cells, T cells+B cells+NK cells) counts were positively associated with clinical outcome (AUC: 0.777; AUC: 0.925; AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.902; AUC: 0.877; AUC: 0.918, resp.). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to T lymphocyte count ratio (NTR), neutrophil percentage to T lymphocyte ratio (NpTR) effectively predicted mortality (AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.905; AUC: 0.932, resp.). Binary logistic regression showed that NpTR was an independent prognostic factor for mortality. Serum IL6 levels were positively correlated with leucocyte count, neutrophil count, and eosinophil count and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count.\nConclusion: These results indicate that leucocyte subsets predict the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with high efficiency.

ACLF frequently occurs in close temporal relationship to a precipitating event, such as acute alcoholic, drug-induced or viral hepatitis or bacterial infection and, in cases without precipitating events, probably related to intestinal translocation of bacterial products. Dysbalanced immune function is central to its pathogenesis and outcome with an initial excessive systemic inflammatory response that drives organ failure and mortality. This hyperinflammatory state ultimately impairs the host defensive mechanisms of immune cells, rendering ACLF patients immunocompromised and more vulnerable to secondary infections, and therefore to higher organ dysfunction and mortality. In this review, we describe the prevailing characteristics of the hyperinflammatory state in patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis developing ACLF, with special emphasis on cells of the innate immune system (i.e., monocytes and neutrophils), their triggers (pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns [PAMPs and DAMPs]), their effector molecules (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and bioactive lipid mediators) and the consequences on tissue immunopathology.

The hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially compromises their innate immune system. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the affected cell. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia-induced glycosylation of ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the binding of S protein to ACE2, enabling viral entry. Downregulation of ACE2 activity secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II and metabolites, eventually leads to poor outcomes. The altered binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the compromised innate immunity of patients with DM increase their susceptibility to COVID-19; COVID-19 induces pancreatic \u03b2-cell injury and poor glycemic control, which further compromises the immune response and aggravates hyperglycemia and COVID-19 progression, forming a vicious cycle. Sequential cleavage of viral S protein by furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers viral entry to release the viral genome into the target cell. Hence, TMPRSS2 and furin are possible drug targets.

This phenomenon has been referred to as the \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d and it is closely linked to lung injury, acute respiratory syndrome and mortality.

Specifically, hemp contains terpenophenolic compounds such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), which act on cannabinoid receptors and positively regulate various human metabolic, immunological, and physiological functions. CBD and CBG have an effect on the cytokine metabolism, which has led to the examination of cannabinoids on the treatment of viral diseases, including COVID-19. Based on genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies, several synthetic pathways of hemp secondary metabolite production have been elucidated. Nevertheless, there are few reports on hemp metabolic engineering despite obvious impact on scientific and industrial sectors.\nIn this article, recent status and current perspectives on hemp metabolic engineering are reviewed. Three distinct approaches to expedite phytochemical yield are discussed. Special emphasis has been placed on transgenic and transient gene delivery systems, which are critical for successful metabolic engineering of hemp.

Some patients with sustained viral replication progress to a severe condition called cytokine storm. Although antiviral drug(s) should be considered early in infection to prevent progression, there have been no antiviral therapies proven to be effective for significantly inhibiting the viral replication in vivo and suppressing the progression to cytokine storm.

The underlying mechanism of neonatal infection susceptibility has generally been related to their under-developed immune system. Nevertheless, this notion has recently been challenged by the discovery of the physiological abundance of immunosuppressive erythroid precursors CD71+\nerythroid cells (CECs) in newborn mice and human cord blood. Here, as proof of concept, we show that these cells are also abundant in the peripheral blood of human newborns. Although their frequency appears to be more variable compared to their counterparts in mice, they rapidly decline by 4 weeks of age. However, their proportion remains significantly higher in infants up to six months of age compared to older infants. We found CD45 expressing CECs, as erythroid progenitors, were the prominent source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both humans and mice. Interestingly, a higher proportion of CD45+CECs was observed in the spleen versus bone marrow of neonatal mice, which was associated with a higher ROS production by splenic CECs compared to their siblings in the bone marrow. CECs from human newborns suppressed cytokine production by CD14 monocytes and T cells, which was partially abrogated by apocynin in vitro. Moreover, the depletion of CECs in neonatal mice increased the number of activated effector immune cells in their spleen and liver, which rendered them more resistant to Listeria monocytogenes infection. This was evident by a significant reduction in the bacteria load in the spleen, liver and brain of treated-mice compared to the control group, which enhanced their survival rate.

Protein expression from immunohistochemistry data was assessed from The Human Protein Atlas database including 144 samples, corresponding to 48 different normal human tissue types, and 432 tumor samples from 216 different cancer patients. The correlations between immune cell infiltration, chemokine, and cytokines were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and TCGA.\nResult: We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP.

ACE2 and AngII are present in many tissues but information on the cornea is lacking. We observed that mice deficient in the Ace2 gene (Ace2\u2212/\u2212), developed a cloudy cornea phenotype as they aged. Haze occupied the central cornea, accompanied by corneal edema and neovascularization. In severe cases with marked chronic inflammation, a cell\u2010fate switch from a transparent corneal epithelium to a keratinized, stratified squamous, psoriasiform\u2010like epidermis was observed. The stroma contained a large number of CD11c, CD68, and CD3 positive cells. Corneal epithelial debridement experiments in young ACE2\u2010deficient mice showed normal appearing corneas, devoid of haze.

However, in some cases (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities) the disease may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that can lead to death. Such wide interindividual differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may relate to several pathogen- and host-related factors. These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L- and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia.

In total, 17 of 24 (71%) patients recovered, 3 of 24 (13%) patients remained critically ill though stable, and 4 of 24 (16%) patients expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment. Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) increase of 192% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% (P value <0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (P\u2009<\u20090.05), 45% (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and 46% (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nWe propose that COVID-19 is a viral multisystem disease, with dominant vascular pathology, mediated by global reduction in ACE2 function, pronounced in disease conditions with RAS bias toward angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) over ACE2. It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss. Relative ACE2 deficiency leads to enhanced and protracted tissue, and vessel exposure to angiotensin II, characterised by vasoconstriction, enhanced thrombosis, cell proliferation and recruitment, increased tissue permeability, and cytokine production (including IL-6) resulting in inflammation. Additionally, there is a profound loss of the \u201cprotective\u201d angiotensin (1\u20137), a vasodilator with anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and antioxidant activity.

Our proposed mechanism of lung injury provides an explanation for early hypoxia without reduction in lung compliance and suggests a need for revision of treatment protocols to address vasoconstriction, thromboprophylaxis, and to minimize additional small airways and alveolar trauma via ventilation choice. Our model predicts long term sequelae of scarring/fibrosis in vessels, lungs, renal and cardiac tissue with protracted illness in at-risk individuals.

Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes).

Given the rarity of this condition, there are no clear recommendations for its management. Systemic corticosteroids and antimalarials are the most commonly used medications used to treat EAE, but many cases have been reported in the literature that are resistant to treatment with these medications. Here, we present a 65-year-old female with EAE refractory to numerous systemic therapies (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, doxycycline, methotrexate) who showed a good response to mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-5.

Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection depends on two human genes: the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as usage of 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population cohort, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed several interesting suggestive associations. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the TMPRSS2 genes were associated with thrombocytes count (p = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125). SNPs within the ACE2 gene were associated with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p = 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22124), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff = 0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22124). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants could play a role in diseases such as thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases.

To deal with this array of threats, the immune system has evolved to include a myriad of specialised cell types, communicating molecules and functional responses. The immune system is always active, carrying out surveillance, but its activity is enhanced if an individual becomes infected. This heightened activity is accompanied by an increased rate of metabolism, requiring energy sources, substrates for biosynthesis and regulatory molecules, which are all ultimately derived from the diet. A number of vitamins (A, B6, B12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) have been demonstrated to have key roles in supporting the human immune system and reducing risk of infections. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important. Each of the nutrients named above has roles in supporting antibacterial and antiviral defence, but zinc and selenium seem to be particularly important for the latter. It would seem prudent for individuals to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to support their immune system to help them deal with pathogens should they become infected. The gut microbiota plays a role in educating and regulating the immune system. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of disease including many infectious diseases and has been described in COVID-19.

Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions. High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events. At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs. In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died. On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons. Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the ACE2 gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous. Secondly, the higher ACE2 expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data. Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17). Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.

Hesperidin is a classical herbal medicine used worldwide for a long time with an excellent safety profile. Hesperidin is a well-known herbal medication used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Available shreds of evidence support the promising use of hesperidin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. Herein, we discuss the possible prophylactic and treatment mechanisms of hesperidin based on previous and recent findings. Hesperidin can block coronavirus from entering host cells through ACE2 receptors which can prevent the infection. Anti-viral activity of hesperidin might constitute a treatment option for COVID-19 through improving host cellular immunity against infection and its good anti-inflammatory activity may help in controlling cytokine storm. Hesperidin mixture with diosmin co-administrated with heparin protect against venous thromboembolism which may prevent disease progression. Based on that, hesperidin might be used as a meaningful prophylactic agent and a promising adjuvant treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 infection."], "7276995": ["Aaron J Wilk, Arjun Rustagi, Nancy Q Zhao, Jonasel Roque, Giovanny J Martinez-Colon, Julia L McKechnie, Geoffrey T Ivison, Thanmayi Ranganath, Rosemary Vergara, Taylor Hollis, Laura J Simpson, Philip Grant, Aruna Subramanian, Angela J Rogers, Catherine A Blish", "7276995", "\nA single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19\n", "There is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

The rationale is that TPE can remove interleukins-3, 6, 8, 10, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, it may reduce the cytokine release syndrome associated with fulminant COVID-19 disease.\nPilot, interventional, open-label, randomized controlled multicenter trial.\nInclusion criteria are: 1) age \u2265 18 years old; 2) intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 3) serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19 (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1).

Also, the study will run in ICUs (Ministry of Health Cluster 1; Riyadh) and other centers in KSA pending their institutional review board (IRB) approval.\nThe intervention group will receive TPE, plus empiric treatment for COVID-19. TPE is administered using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA). The first dose is 1.5 plasma volumes, followed by one plasma volume on alternate days or daily for five to seven total treatments. Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant (ACDA) as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2019 guidelines. Plasma is replaced with albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy (prothrombin time >37 seconds; international normalized ratio >3; activated partial thromboplastin time >100 or fibrinogen level <100 mg/d). TPE sessions are performed daily over four hours and laboratory markers measured daily. The comparators are controls not receiving TPE but usual empiric treatment for COVID-19 as per institutional, national and international recommendations. Both groups will receive standard ICU supportive care.\nPrimary study end-point is 28-day mortality and safety of TPE in serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Safety will be evaluated by the documentation of any pertinent adverse and/or serious adverse effects related to TPE as per institutional, national and international (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines. Secondary outcomes are: i) improvement in Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score ; ii) changes in inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6; iii) days on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.\nEligible consented patients are randomized (1:1 allocation) after stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (> 150 and \u2264 150). Randomization occurs in variable block sizes of four to eight patients. A web-based randomization service, randomize.net, is used to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy.\nGiven the visibility of TPE machinery, the intervention will be unblinded; hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited.

Children are affected less, and most experience a milder disease. As rheumatologists, we deal with the uncontrolled response of the immune system, and most of the drugs we use are either immune modulators or immunosuppressants. Thus, the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, our patients with rheumatic diseases constitute a vulnerable group in this pandemic.

Early anecdotal reports and limited\u00a0in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID\u201019 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high\u2010quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac\u00a0side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto\u2010immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in\u00a0patients with COVID\u201019, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID\u201019. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID\u201019, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or\u00a0detract from the use of these agents\u00a0for the treatment of COVID\u201019 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach."], "7267633": ["H.

We propose here the first model, explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10\u201015 days after infection, hangs on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, Mannose Binding Lectin ). If SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low\u2010moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID\u201019, facilitates early direct penetration of high numbers of virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway\u2019s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies. This allows the virus bypassing the efficient immune barrier of the upper airways mucosa in already infected, young and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptative immune response reach the lungs first, is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.

The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and NALP3 inflammasome pathways.

Several specific anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents are being evaluated by ongoing clinical trials; however, there is currently insufficient evidence for their efficacy and safety in COVID-19 treatment. Given the role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE) 4 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the inflammatory response, we hypothesize that selective PDE4 inhibition may attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19, through the upstream inhibition of pro-inflammatory molecules, particularly TNF-\u03b1, and the regulation of the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. Conversely, other anti-cytokine agents lead to the downstream inhibition of specific targets, such as IL-1, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1, and may not be efficient in blocking the cytokine storm, once it has been triggered. Due to their mechanism of action targeting an early stage of the inflammatory response and ameliorating lung inflammation, we believe that selective PDE4 inhibitors may represent a promising treatment option for the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia before the cytokine storm and severe multiorgan dysfunction take place. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibitors present several advantages including an excellent safety profile; the oral route of administration; the convenient dosing; and beneficial metabolic properties.

A more intense \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19.\nIt is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications.\nIn the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19.\nMontelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease.\nTwo advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam.\nPatients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury.

Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not.

Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient's HScore [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93\u201396%. Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24\u202fh. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48\u202fh, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11\u202fdays feeling fit and well.\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question \u2013 is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10\u201314. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.

However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs).

These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death.\nOne of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don\u2019t have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections.\nFor investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized.

New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies.\nA hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID-19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes.\nSecond, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19.

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40\u201360 ng/mL (100\u2013150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.

The p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has been implicated in acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction. The overwhelming inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection may be caused by disproportionately upregulated p38 activity, explained by two mechanisms. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity is lost during SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs and heart and converts Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1\u20137. Angiotensin II signals proinflammatory, pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-thrombotic activity through p38 MAPK activation, which is countered by Angiotensin 1\u20137 downregulation of p38 activity. Loss of ACE2 upon viral entry may tip the balance towards destructive p38 signaling through Angiotensin II. Second, SARS-CoV was previously shown to directly upregulate p38 activity via a viral protein, similar to other RNA respiratory viruses that may hijack p38 activity to promote replication. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter may employ a similar mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may induce overwhelming inflammation by directly activating p38 and downregulating a key inhibitory pathway, while simultaneously taking advantage of p38 activity to replicate. Therapeutic inhibition of p38 could therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model. A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious COVID-19 infection."], "7228868": ["Bo Yu, Chenze Li, Peng Chen, Ning Zhou, Luyun Wang, Jia Li, Hualiang Jiang, Dao-Wen Wang", "7228868", "Low dose of hydroxychloroquine reduces fatality of critically ill patients with COVID-19", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality.

Cardiovascular protective strategies are urgent and of great significance to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Hyperactivated inflammation plays an important role in all three mechanisms and is considered to be fundamental in the development of cardiovascular impairment and MODS in COVID-19.

Recommendations are based on the phases of the disease, because optimal interventions for one phase may not be appropriate for a different phase. The four phases addressed are: Prevention, Infection, Inflammation and Recovery.\nUnderlying this phased approach is recognition of emerging evidence for two different components of pathophysiology, early infection and late stage severe complications. These two aspects of the disease suggest two different patterns of clinical emphasis that seem on the surface to be not entirely concordant. We describe the application of therapeutic strategies and appropriate tactics that address four main stages of disease progression for COVID-19.\nEmerging evidence in COVID-19 suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may both evade the innate immune response and kill macrophages. Delayed innate immune response and a depleted population of macrophages can theoretically result in a blunted antigen presentation, delaying and diminishing activation of the adaptive immune response. Thus, one clinical strategy involves supporting patient innate and adaptive immune responses early in the time course of illness, with the goal of improving the timeliness, readiness, and robustness of both the innate and adaptive immune responses.\nAt the other end of the disease pathology spectrum, risk of fatality in COVID-19 is driven by excessive and persistent upregulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with cytokine storm. Thus, the second clinical strategy is to prevent or mitigate excessive inflammatory response to prevent the cytokine storm associated with high mortality risk.\nClinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory. This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects). This creates a need for discernment about the time course of the illness and with that, understanding of which components of an overall strategy to apply at each phase of the time course of the illness.\nWe review evidence from early observational studies and the existing literature on both outcomes and mechanisms of disease, to inform a phased approach to support the patient at risk for infection, with infection, with escalating inflammation during infection, and at risk of negative sequelae as they move into recovery."], "7188425": ["Dijoia B.

Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies. Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (\u201cdebris\u201d)-induced \u201ceicosanoid storm\u201d, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins. Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution. SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive. SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm. Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection. Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation. While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on \u201canti-viral\u201d and \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.

The live and killed vaccines are available for the prevention of infection in the market, but the drug for the treatment is not available. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a member of thiazolides, is an antiparasitic drug. In the present study, the effect of NTZ on the NDV replication was explored. The experiments were conducted in chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), PBMC, embryonated chicken eggs, and two-week old chickens. The inhibition of the NDV was observed upon post-treatment of NTZ at a concentration of ~12.5\u00a0\u03bcM. Cytokine profiling of the DF-1, PBMC, and chicken embryonic tissue treated with NTZ revealed significant upregulation in all the cytokines studied except for IL-1\u03b2 in DF-1 cells.

In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

Here, we hypothesize that diabetes-induced osteopontin and furin protein upregulation results in worse outcomes in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to the roles of these protein in promoting viral infection and increasing metabolic dysfunction.

COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization.

Together with Src and other signaling proteins, the Na/K-ATPase forms an oxidant amplification loop (NKAL), amplifies ROS, and participates in cytokines storm in obesity. The development of a peptide fragment of the \u03b11 subunit, NaKtide, has been shown to negatively regulate Src. Several groups showed that the systemic administration of the cell permeable modification of NaKtide (pNaKtide) or its selective delivery to fat tissue\u2014adipocyte specific expression of NaKtide\u2014ameliorate the systemic elevation of inflammatory cytokines seen in chronic obesity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome \u2013 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the RNA Coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic, invades cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (ACE2R) that is appended in inflamed fat tissue and exacerbates the formation of the cytokines storm. Both obesity and heart and renal failure are well known risks for adverse outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. White adipocytes express ACE-2 receptors in high concentration, especially in obese patients. Once the virus invades the white adipocyte cell, it creates a COVID19\u2013porphyrin complex which degrades and produces free porphyrin and iron and increases ROS. The increased formation of ROS and activation of the NKAL results in a further potentiated formation of ROS production, and ultimately, adipocyte generation of more inflammatory mediators, leading to systemic cytokines storm and heart failure. Moreover, chronic obesity also results in the reduction of antioxidant genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), increasing adipocyte susceptibility to ROS and cytokines. It is the systemic inflammation and cytokine storm which is responsible for many of the adverse outcomes seen with COVID-19 infections in obese subjects, leading to heart failure and death.

Here we treated human pulmonary fibroblasts from control donors with IL-1\u03b2 and used Atomic Force Microscopy to unveil that IL-1\u03b2 significantly reduces the stiffness of fibroblasts concomitantly with a downregulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and alpha-smooth muscle (\u03b1-SMA).

These mechanobiology changes were functionally associated with reduced proliferation and enhanced migration upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, which could facilitate lung repair by drawing fibroblasts to sites of tissue damage. Our observations reveal that IL-1\u03b2 may reduce local tissue rigidity by acting both intracellularly and extracellularly through the downregulation of fibroblast contractility and type I collagen deposition, respectively. These IL-1\u03b2-dependent mechanical effects may enhance lung repair further by locally increasing pulmonary tissue compliance to preserve normal lung distension and function.

Host response modulation in coinfected alveolar epithelial cells were primarily related to TLR- and inflammatory response-mediated cell signaling events. While less extensive in cocultured endothelial cells, coinfection resulted in changes to cellular stress response- and TLR-related signaling events.

Selenium enhances the function of cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, selenium is important for maintaining T cell maturation and functions, as well as for T cell-dependent antibody production. Vitamin C is considered an antiviral agent as it increases immunity. Administration of vitamin C increased the survival rate of COVID-19 patients by attenuating excessive activation of the immune response.

While most patients infected with the COVID-19 virus have no to moderate symptoms, there is currently limited clinical information about these patients.\nMethods: In this study, we retrospectively investigated 41 patients infected with the COVID-19 virus in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China, from February 4 to March 2, 2020. Nanchang is about 260 km southeast of Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrieved information on patient demographics, physical examination results, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying conditions, laboratory analyses, radiological images, and treatment outcomes.\nResults: Most patients (70.7%) had a history of close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19, and 16 patients (39.0%) showed a high degree of family clustering. All 41 patients had no to moderate symptoms. The median age was 39.9 years and common symptoms of illness were fever (69.2%), cough (65.4%), and fatigue (19.2%). The dominant patient group was middle-aged women, with hypertension (14.6%) and chronic liver disease (12.2%) as the most frequent underlying conditions. All patients recovered, with the mean time of viral nucleic acid clearance at 10.6 days. Chest CT scans presented ground-glass opacities in 53.7% of patients while 26.8% had normal CT images. Laboratory results showed that lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte percentages, ESR, CRP, IgG, Fib, and cytokines were correlated to patients' conditions. Approximately 60\u201390% of patients had abnormally high levels of cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and/or TNF-\u03b1.\nConclusions: Our results showed variable clinical and laboratory presentations among this group of patients infected with the COVID-19 virus.

In particular, preventive measures of COVID-19, such as staying at home, are sedentarism measures that decrease physical activity. Physical inactivity alters gut microbiome structure in a fashion that promotes gut dysbiosis and flaring of systemic inflammation, leading to the buildup of body fat. Obesity, which contributes to a trail of health-depleting disorders, furthers gut microbial disintegration while fat tissue stimulates the release of cytokines, promotes metabolic resistance, and alters signaling involved in the production of antioxidants. As a result, the body gets flooded by toxic molecules such pro-inflammatory mediators, free radicals, and advanced glycation end products. These toxic molecules alter cellular function in all body tissues, including those of the brain. Neuroinflammation is associated with progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions along with dysregulation in emotions.

Among pro-inflammatory factors produced during COVID-19, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by activated neutrophils have been specifically shown to activate premetastatic cancer cells disseminated in the lungs, suggesting they may be involved in DCCs reawakening in COVID-19 patients.

There is emerging evidence that an aberrant immune response in the initial stages of infection lead to severe disease. Many inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators are significantly higher in patients with severe dengue compared to those who develop mild infection, during febrile phase of illness. Monocytes, mast cells, and many other cells of the immune system, when infected with the DENV, especially in the presence of poorly neutralizing antibodies, leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of interferon signaling pathways. In addition, production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 further leads to inhibition of cellular antiviral responses. This dysregulated and aberrant immune response leads to reduced clearance of the virus, and severe dengue by inducing a vascular leak and excessive inflammation due to high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Individuals with comorbid illnesses could be prone to more severe dengue due to low grade endotoxemia, gut microbial dysbiosis and an altered phenotype of innate immune cells. The immunosuppressive and inflammatory lipid mediators and altered phenotype of monocytes are likely to further act on T cells and B cells leading to an impaired adaptive immune response to the virus.

The accelerated fetal growth during late pregnancy has been known for some time, while the impact of maternal stressors during this time on fetal development and by extent its postnatal repercussions on health and performance are still being defined. Maternal stressors during late pregnancy cannot only influence colostrogenesis but also compromise adequate intestinal development in the fetus, thus, that further limits the newborn\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients, bioactive compounds, and immunity (i.e., immunoglobulins, cytokines, and immune cells) from colostrum.

Besides the dense-nutrient content and immunity in colostrum, it contains bioactive compounds such as growth factors, hormones, and cholesterol as well as molecular signals or instructions [e.g., microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] transferred from mother to offspring with the aim to influence postnatal gut maturation.

Intriguingly, 17 compounds from the 5 most commonly used herbs were revealed to have direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential by docking with the two core structures [CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (6SVB) and CoV 3CL hydrolase (6LU7)]. Seven reported COVID-19 drugs served as positive controls; among them, retionavir (-7.828 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-8.738 kcal/mol) performed best with 6VSB and 6LU7, respectively. The top candidate was madreselvin B (6SVB: -8.588 kcal/mol and 6LU7: -9.017 kcal/mol), an appreciable component of Flos Lonicerae. Eighty-six compounds from 22 unlisted herbs were further identified among 2,042 natural compounds, completing our arsenal for TCM formulations. The mechanisms have been implicated as multifactorial, including activation of immunoregulation (Th2, PPAR and IL10), suppression of acute inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF, COX2/1, etc.), enhancement of antioxidative activity (CAT and SOD1), and modulation of apoptosis (inhibited CASP3). It is of interest to understand the biological mechanisms of TCM recipes. We then analyzed 18 representative remedies based on molecular targets associated with 14 medical conditions over the disease course, e.g., pyrexia, coughing, asthenia, lymphopenia, cytokine storm, etc. The significant level of coherence (SLC) revealed, in part, the potential uses and properties of corresponding TCMs. Thus, herbal plants coordinate to combat COVID-19 in multiple dimensions, casting a light of hope before effective vaccines are developed."], "7607337": ["Lucy Paterson-Brown, James Brighouse, Nick Wilkinson", "7607337", "O16\u2003Learning from acute COVID-19in a patient with potential immune dysregulation", "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents have been at minimal risk of admission to hospital and intensive care from SARS-COV2 and exhibited a different phenotype of critical illness to adults. We present a 9-year-old Caucasian boy who, early in the pandemic, became PCR positive and was admitted to paediatric intensive care (PICU) with an adult phenotype of hyperinflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has trisomy 21 and last year was admitted to PICU with ARDS and macrophage activation syndrome. We share how this early case influenced our thinking and subsequent management of cases thought to have PIMS-TS.\nHe presented to a district hospital on March 31st with fever and persistent cough without respiratory or other compromise. Discharged home with oral antibiotics, he obtunded within 18\u2009h and returned as an emergency with persistent fever, cough, and haemoptysis with Sa02 77% in 15litres oxygen. Following intubation, a large pulmonary haemorrhage made ventilation difficult and three cardiac arrests occurred prior to transfer on inotropic support.\nOn arrival, results showed Lymphocytes 1.2, Hb 104, Platelets 365, Ferritin 2059, INR 1.2, Procalcitonin (PCT) 43.84, CRP 219, CK 296, LDH 2035, Albumin 35, D-dimer 37.55. SARS-COV2 was confirmed in endotracheal secretions. All other microbiology investigations remained negative other than a scanty growth of Candida. Radiology demonstrated bilateral opacifications and pleural effusions. Blood film was consistent with the clinical picture with no signs of malignancy. Subsequent key results included cytopenia with troughs of Hb 86, Lymphocytes 0.2, Platelets 84; peak Ferritin 6283, d-dimer 50.60 and PCT >100, plateauing by day 7.\nHe was ventilated for 23\u2009days requiring high pressures (PIP consistently >30), nitric oxide and inotropes. There was no clinical improvement despite optimal supportive treatment, but immunomodulation was held during repeat microbiology investigation and concern for losing a fine care balance. However, when formally considering ECMO, a trial of Anakinra 4\u2009mg/kg increasing to 8\u2009mg/kg twice daily over 4\u2009days (day 5\u20139) was commenced. The inflammatory markers had already plateaued then started to fall and there was no meaningful respiratory improvement with anakinra. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered day 9\u201310, but improvement in respiratory function only occurred with IV methylprednisolone 10\u2009mg/kg/dose when (days 16\u201318) the team felt immunomodulation was safe and data from adult intensive care was supportive. He transferred to the ward on day 30 and discharged to his local hospital on day 83. PCR remained positive until day 32.\nAs in other children with evidence of SARS-COV2, this child showed a rapid and unpredictable decline in condition, but he presented with an opportunity for prevention of the ensuing hyperinflammation. There is a need for research to identify a fingerprint of inflammation that predicts subsequent decline and the value of prompt, safe immunomodulation to distract from critical cytokine cascades.\nIt is unclear why this boy was one of very few children to develop an adult phenotype but given an altered immune state associated with trisomy 21 and a previous episode of ARDS with hyperinflammation it would suggest that inherent Trisomy 21 genetic risk factors may be involved. He also had previously been identified to features of chronic lung disease that was a contributing factor.\nSuccessful management of this child resulted from rigorous organ support and close collaboration between consultants and junior staff in PICU, infectious diseases and rheumatology.\nThis was the beginning of a critical relationship that allowed rapid sharing of information and concerns to maintain safety and explore differentials and treatment strategies. A decision to commence immunomodulation had to consider the fragile state of support and risk; for instance, from fluid overload, the background risk of infection and neoplasia and professionals understanding of drug safety. Anakinra was used first due to a short half-life, extensive safety data in toxic shock and routine use in rheumatology. IVIG was delayed due to fluid volume, but neither this nor anakinra had a meaningful clinical effect. The key response to steroids is like that reported in adults including the RECOVERY trial.\nOther learning points showed unexpected patterns and limited utility of blood investigations, as seen later in PIMS-TS. This included incongruence in peaks of ferritin and LDH and delayed recovery of cell lines except Hb which was an early signal of improvement.\nA collaborative approach across teams during the care of this patient was critical and primed relationships prior to the surge of PIMS-TS cases. The role of rheumatology has been clearly defined by its familiarity with the benefit and safety of immunomodulatory agents, which has enabled support of intensive care and infectious disease teams in their use.\nThis patient may also have highlighted a predisposition in some cohorts to states of hyperinflammation given his previous episode last year. Is this due to his trisomy 21 and suspected immune dysregulation or other factors, as we know these patients are at an increased risk of infections and autoimmune conditions?\nClinical course in children is unpredictable and frequently associated with rapid decline. Teams must remain flexible and able to respond with different treatment strategies as cases continue to evolve. Here there was an adult phenotype and supportive treatment remained key. As in adult care the benefit of steroids in ventilated patients was clear. However, ongoing research is required to examine the safety (and benefit) of early immunomodulation use when other differentials (including sepsis and malignancy) have not been fully or reliably excluded.\nThere is an argument to use immunomodulation early in the presentation of similar patients in the future. Further molecular biological studies such as the DIAMOND study may help us identify key inflammatory pathways and subsequently screening tools to inform such initial treatment and avoid the rapid decline and hospital or PICU admission. Each immunomodulator has distinct characteristics and response to treatment is not predictable. Does this inform treatment algorithms in the absence of evidence from trials? In the absence of trials for this phenotype should treatment follow an adult based algorithm.\nWe hope that by sharing this case it will stimulate further discussion and research to help us treat future similar patients."], "7607333": ["Yun Zou, Bhavisha Vasta", "7607333", "EP14\u2003COVID-19 associated aortitis", "Since the emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there has been increasing recognition of the potential associated cardio-vascular manifestations. There have been reports of Kawasaki like disease in children. However, in adults there are very few reports of non-cutaneous vasculitis. Here we report the case of an adult male presenting with an inflammatory aortitis associated with COVID-19 infection.\nA 71-year-old Caucasian male with a background of cholecystectomy and rotator cuff repair presented to hospital in May 2020 with a 3-month history of feeling generally unwell, weight loss and worsening thoraco-lumbar back pain. Prior to the onset of these symptoms he had had a 2-week illness in March 2020 clinically consistent with COVID-19 infection comprising fevers, hot sweats, dry cough, and chest tightness for which he had not sought medical attention. He had no recent travel history. Physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn admission, COVID-19 tests revealed evidence of prior infection with negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test but positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Blood tests revealed a marked inflammatory state with a C- reactive protein of 122mg/L, plasmas viscosity of 2.76, Ferritin 777ug/L, Interleukin-6 of 25\u2009ng/L and normocytic anaemia with a Haemoglobin of 77g/L. Immunology tests were negative for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-glomerular basement antibodies, HLA-B27, anti-citrullinated protein antibody, rheumatoid factor, and nuclear antibodies, with normal IgG 4 subclasses. Microbiology workup showed negative blood cultures, syphilis screen and Hepatitis B and C serology. Temporal artery ultrasound was unremarkable. Troponin-T, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal. CT thorax abdomen pelvis revealed inflammatory change surrounding the aortic arch extending all the way down the aorta in keeping with a florid inflammatory aortitis with no aneurysms seen.\nRapid resolution of symptoms was seen with commencement of Prednisolone 40mg once daily, with normalisation of CRP one week later and subsequent normalisation of haemoglobin and plasma viscosity. A repeat CT aorta 2 weeks after commencement of prednisolone demonstrated a reduction in the thickness of the inflammatory rind over the aorta from 6mm to 2mm. The patient now continues a reducing regime of prednisolone and remains in clinical remission. \nIn children, Kawasaki like disease associated with COVID-19 is well described and can result in coronary artery inflammation and aneurysm. In adults, COVID-19 associated cutaneous vasculitis is well recognised however there are only a small number of case reports of organ specific vasculitis including the central nervous system, retina, and small bowel. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of aortitis associated with COVID-19 infection in an adult patient. \nThe mechanisms underlying the development of COVID-19 associated vasculitis are not established but may be secondary to endothelial inflammation. Findings from a histological case series suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect endothelial cells directly, possibly via endothelial ACE2 receptors, leading to inflammation in the endothelium. Another postulated mechanism is that endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation is caused by the cytokine storm that can be seen in some patients with COVID-19 infection. \nOur patient responded very well to corticosteroid treatment. However, in case of a relapse his cytokine profile could be helpful in directing further therapeutic options. IL-6 levels were elevated in our patient. Studies show that IL-6 appears to play a dominant role in the cytokine storm. In a report of 150 patients IL-6 was found to be significantly higher in the group with severe disease and possibly predictive of mortality. The IL-6 antagonist, Tocilizumab, has also been used with promising results. The first report of its use was in China in 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients with significant improvements. Since this first report, further clinical trials are underway investigating the efficacy and tolerability of IL-6 antagonists in patients with COVID-19 disease.

These include skin lesions, arthritis, ocular disease, CNS, GI, and vascular involvement. Arterial disease can affect medium and large sized arteries, leading to aneurysm development with the potential to rupture. We report a case of Behcet\u2019s disease presenting in such a manner, with multiple aneurysms at imminent risk of arterial rupture. The presentation occurred at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 with the patient contracting the virus complicating cyclophosphamide immunosuppression therapy post operatively.\nA 54-year-old man had been under rheumatology follow up for numerous years. He reported recurrent oral ulcers, and episodic fevers. He previously had confirmed cerebral sinus thrombosis, aseptic endocarditis, multiple pulmonary emboli and was investigated for inflammatory bowel disease.\u00a0\nHe presented acutely to AE with a painful, tender left calf and a large pulsatile mass in the calf. He reported paraesthesia in his left leg/foot suggestive of nerve compression. CT angiogram performed, revealed a large\u00a06.5cm x 4cm left tibioperoneal trunk (TPT) pseudoaneurysm (Fig.1), and 1.2cm right anterior tibial (ATA) pseudoaneurysm (Fig 2). There was also a 3.8cm infrarenal inflammatory abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm (Fig 3), and finally a 2.3cm right lower lobe pulmonary artery aneurysm. Laboratory investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers, with ESR of 120 and CRP 73. A diagnosis of vascular Behcet\u2019s was suspected.\u00a0\nUrgent surgical intervention was deemed necessary to prevent limb and life-threatening complications of arterial rupture. He underwent open surgical decompression and graft repair of the left TPT aneurysm. Endovascular stenting of infrarenal AAA was performed and the right ATA aneurysm was ligated and excised. The pulmonary artery aneurysm was managed conservatively, but interval CT Imaging post immunosuppression treatment showed complete resolution. This undoubtedly was due to immunosuppression therapy.\nThe first cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone infusion were given day 1 post-op. The following day he developed a fever and a dry cough. He subsequently tested positive for SARS-COV-2. This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. He required supplementary oxygen, but his condition did not deteriorate further, and he made a complete recovery. A difficult dilemma was posed between immunosuppression and the risk of infection having been diagnosed with COVID-19. An MDT approach was adopted, and input was sought from the Birmingham Bechet\u2019s centre of excellence. He continued immunosuppressive treatment once recovered from the virus.\nBechet\u2019s disease is considered a form of systemic vasculitis and is unique in its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes from the arterial and venous systems. Vascular manifestations in Bechet\u2019s disease are associated with increased mortality and morbidity with manifestations more common in men. Arterial rupture is the leading cause of sudden death in patients with Bechet\u2019s disease. Endovascular and perivascular inflammation of large vessels can lead to haemorrhage, aneurysm formation with risk of rupture, stenosis, and thrombus development.\u00a0\nTo prevent potential life-threatening complications of vascular Bechet\u2019s, a combination of surgical/radiological and medical management is often required. High dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide infusions are typically used, with aim to achieve disease remission. It is recommended that if surgical/radiological interventions are indicated, it should ideally be performed when the disease is quiescent. However, urgent intervention is required if the aneurysm is at high risk of rupture, rapidly enlarging or if there is organ threatening ischemia. This was the approach used in this patient.\nPotent immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids is indicated in arterial disease of Bechet\u2019s. The inherent risk of infection with these agents, being used at the peak of a global pandemic created a challenging clinical dilemma. To complicate matters further, the patient developed fever and cough following the 1st cyclophosphamide/steroid treatment and tested positive for COVID-19. His condition was relatively mild however and made a full recovery from the virus.\u00a0\nBehcet\u2019s disease can be a difficult and challenging condition to diagnose. There is often a delay in diagnosis. Our patient was previously referred to a tertiary Bechet\u2019s centre but felt there was insufficient clinical grounds to make the diagnosis at that stage.\nThis case provides a rare example of an immunosuppressed patient with rheumatic disease contracting COVID-19 after extensive vascular intervention. A poor outcome may have been expected but in contrary the patient\u2019s disease course was mild. This perhaps supports the theory that immunosuppression may play a protective role during COVID-19.\nThe role of immunosuppression in a hyperinflammatory COVID-19 state is an area of much research interest. Suppression of the cytokine storm with immune therapy has been hypothesised as a potential therapy target for some COVID-19 patients. However, this is still unproven. Corticosteroid treatment with dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in hospital, through the Recovery Trial. In addition, encouraging evidence continues to emerge for the role of IL1 and IL6 inhibitors in the cytokine storm.\u00a0\nIt is rare for a patient to present with such extensive aneurysmal disease. Vascular complications of Bechet\u2019s although rare need to be considered.\nThe management for vascular manifestations of Bechet\u2019s disease requires co-ordination and collaborative work between Rheumatologists, Vascular surgery, and Radiologists. Guidance from expert centres is highly recommended. Prompt medical and surgical intervention is needed to prevent serious limb and life-threatening complications of arterial Bechet\u2019s disease.\nOur case raises the clinical conundrum of immunosuppression therapy in serious organ threatening rheumatic disease with concomitant COVID-19 infection. A patient-centred approach with patient involvement in clinical decisions is required. Patients and clinicians alike should balance the risks associated with organ threatening rheumatic disease and infection risks. The current global coronavirus pandemic makes such decisions more difficult with an additional communicable disease prevalent in the community. With few clinically proven therapies and no vaccine available for COVID-19, Rheumatologists will have to grapple with this dilemma for the foreseeable future.\u00a0"], "7607321": ["Arslan Sidhu, Shilpa Selvan, Ziad Alkutobi", "7607321", "EP02\u2003A rare case of Reactive arthritis secondary to COVID-19", "In December 2019, the first cluster of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China.

COVID-19 was initially thought to cause respiratory complications only, however several extra pulmonary manifestations of the infection have since emerged. \nWe report a rare case of reactive arthritis (ReA), urticarial rash and angioedema in a young female secondary to COVID-19 infection. Rashes were recently added to the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 demonstrating their significance.\nA 31-year-old female doctor was admitted with acute swelling of her lips, dysphagia, and a widespread urticarial rash. Preceding this she had a one-week history of fever, cough, and constitutional symptoms of malaise and weight loss. Her symptoms had started at the end of April 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Three days later she developed painful swelling of her wrists, elbows, knees, and hands. She reported no back or sacroiliac joint pain, enthesitis or any previous history of inflammatory joint pains.

ReA most commonly presents as an asymmetrical peripheral or axial spondyloarthropathy. The affected joints do not contain pathogen. More than half of ReA cases resolve spontaneously within six months without requiring long-term treatments. \nUp to 20% of patients with COVID-19 infection have been shown to develop cutaneous manifestations including erythematous rash, vesicular rash, acral ischaemia, rash with petechiae, and widespread urticaria. This has led to the recent addition of rashes to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, as COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days where patients can be asymptomatic, cutaneous manifestations may serve as an early indicator of infection, aiding in a more rapid diagnosis.\nWe present a rare case of ReA secondary to COVID-19 infection, with complete resolution of symptoms following administration of oral glucocorticoids. A detailed history and examination of the musculoskeletal system should be undertaken in all patients presenting with COVID-19.

As per the literature, the SARS-CoV-2 is known to exploit humanACE2 receptors (similar toprevious SARS-CoV-1) for gaining entry into the host cell for invasion, infection, multiplication and pathogenesis. However, considering the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 along with the complex etiology and pathophysiological outcomes seen in COVID-19 patients, it seems that there may be an alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. I performed comparative protein sequence analysis, database based gene expression profiling, bioinformatics based molecular docking using authentic tools and techniques for unveiling the molecular basis of high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previous known coronaviruses. My study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) harbors a RGD motif in its receptor binding domain (RBD) and the motif is absent in all other previously known SARS-CoVs. The RGD motif is well known for its role in cell-attachment and cell-adhesion. My hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 may be (via RGD) exploiting integrins, that have high expression in lungs and all other vital organs, for invading host cells. However, an experimental verification is required. The expression of ACE2, which is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was found to be negligible in lungs. I assume that higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 could be due to this RGD-integrin mediated acquired cell-adhesive property. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of integrins is significantly high in lung cells, in particular \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b28 and an ECM protein, ICAM1. The molecular docking experiment showed the RBD of spike protein binds with integrins precisely at RGD motif in a similar manner as a synthetic RGD peptide binds to integrins as found by other researchers. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a number of phosphorylation sites that can induce cAMP, PKC, Tyr signaling pathways. These pathways either activate calcium ion channels or get activated by calcium. In fact, integrins have calcium & metal binding sites that were predicted around and in vicinity of RGD-integrin docking site in our analysis which suggests that RGD-integrins interaction possibly occurs in calcium-dependent manner. The higher expression of integrins in lungs along with their previously known high binding affinity (~KD\u00a0=\u00a04.0\u00a0nM) for virus RGD motif could serve as a possible explanation for high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. On the contrary, human ACE2 has lower expression in lungs and its high binding affinity (~KD\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0nM) for spike RBD alone could not manifest significant virus-host attachment. This suggests that besides human ACE2, an additional or alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to exist. A highly relevant evidence never reported earlier which corroborate in favor of RGD-integrins mediated virus-host attachment is an unleashed cytokine storm which causes due to activation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 activation; and integrins role in their activation is also well established. Altogether, the current study has highlighted possible role of calcium and other divalent ions in RGD-integrins interaction for virus invasion into host cells and suggested that lowering divalent ion in lungs could avert virus-host cells attachment."], "7641589": ["Pooja Vashistha, Ajay Kumar Gupta, Mona Arya, Vijay Kumar Singh, Abhishek Dubey, Bidhan Chandra Koner", "7641589", "Biclonal gammopathay in a case of severe COVID-19", "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2.

Currently, there is a critical shortage of proven treatment options and an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of multi-organ failure and lung damage. Cytokine storm is associated with severe inflammation and organ damage during COVID-19. However, a detailed molecular pathway defining this cytokine storm is lacking, and gaining mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 elicits a hyperactive inflammatory response is critical to develop effective therapeutics. Of the multiple inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that the combined production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 specifically induced inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, characterized by gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis, caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, and MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Deletion of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis mediators individually was not sufficient to protect against cell death. However, cells deficient in both RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were resistant to this cell death. Mechanistically, the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis activated by TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 co-treatment induced iNOS for the production of nitric oxide. Pharmacological and genetic deletion of this pathway inhibited pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of PANoptosis protected mice from TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3-induced lethal cytokine shock that mirrors the pathological symptoms of COVID-19. In vivo neutralization of both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in multiple disease models associated with cytokine storm showed that this treatment provided substantial protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock models, demonstrating the broad physiological relevance of this mechanism.

Quantitative differences in IFNAR binding correlate with antiviral activity, but whether IFN-Is exhibit qualitative differences remains controversial. Moreover, the IFN-I response is protective during acute HIV-1 infection, but likely pathogenic during the chronic stages. To gain a deeper understanding of the IFN-I response, we compared the interferomes of IFN\u03b1 subtypes dominantly-expressed in HIV-1-exposed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1, 2, 5, 8 and 14) and IFN\u03b2 in the earliest cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. Primary gut CD4 T cells from 3 donors were treated for 18 hours ex vivo with individual IFN-Is normalized for IFNAR signaling strength. Of 1,969 IFN-regulated genes, 246 \u2018core ISGs\u2019 were induced by all IFN-Is tested. However, many IFN-regulated genes were not shared between the IFN\u03b1 subtypes despite similar induction of canonical antiviral ISGs such as ISG15, RSAD2 and MX1, formally demonstrating qualitative differences between the IFN\u03b1 subtypes. Notably, IFN\u03b2 induced a broader interferome than the individual IFN\u03b1 subtypes. Since IFN\u03b2, and not IFN\u03b1, is upregulated during chronic HIV-1 infection in the gut, we compared core ISGs and IFN\u03b2-specific ISGs from colon pinch biopsies of HIV-1-uninfected (n = 13) versus age- and gender-matched, antiretroviral-therapy na\u00efve persons with HIV-1 (PWH; n = 19). Core ISGs linked to inflammation, T cell activation and immune exhaustion were elevated in PWH, positively correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and gut IFN\u03b2 levels, and negatively correlated with gut CD4 T cell frequencies. In sharp contrast, IFN\u03b2-specific ISGs linked to protein translation and anti-inflammatory responses were significantly downregulated in PWH, negatively correlated with gut IFN\u03b2 and LPS, and positively correlated with plasma IL6 and gut CD4 T cell frequencies.

Population-based studies revealed that the use of antinflammatory drugs led to a 23% risk reduction prostate cancer occurrence, a negative association that was stronger in men who specifically used COX-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, patients that were taking aspirin had a 21% reduction in prostate cancer risk, and further, long-term users of daily low dose aspirin had a 29% prostate cancer risk reduction as compared to the controls. Environmental exposure to bacterial and viral infections, exposure to mutagenic agents, and genetic variations predispose the prostate gland to inflammation, with a coordinated elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TGF-\u03b2). It is the dynamics within the tumor microenvironment that empower these cytokines to promote survival and growth of the primary tumor and facilitate disease progression by navigating the immunoregulatory network, phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, anoikis resistance, and metastasis.

The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1\u03b1 is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1\u03b1 are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called \u201chypoxic conditioning\u201d to activate HIF-1\u03b1-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19.

Aging is characterized by a general condition of low-grade inflammation, also connected to chronic inflammation of the brain (neuroinflammation), which is involved in frailty syndrome and contributes to several age-associated diseases, including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Since neuroinflammation can be induced or worsened by the virus infection itself, as well as by stressful conditions like those linked to the recent pandemic, the role of neuroinflammatory mechanisms could be central in a vicious circle leading to an increase in the mortality risk in aged COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, triggered neuroinflammatory pathways and consequent neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions might be potential long-term complications of COVID-19.

WNV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS), where it directly infects neurons and induces neuronal cell death, in part, via activation of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. WNV infection also induces neuroinflammation characterized by activation of innate immune cells, including microglia and astrocytes, production of inflammatory cytokines, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and monitor the CNS for signs of injury or pathogens. Following infection with WNV, microglia exhibit a change in morphology consistent with activation and are associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent research has focused on deciphering the role of microglia during WNV encephalitis. Microglia play a protective role during infections by limiting viral growth and reducing mortality in mice. However, it also appears that activated microglia are triggered by T cells to mediate synaptic elimination at late times during infection, which may contribute to long-term neurological deficits following a neuroinvasive WNV infection.

The structural analysis suggests that the virus enters human cells through the ligation of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The progression of Covid-19 has been divided into three main stages: stage I\u2014viral response, stage II\u2014pulmonary phase, and stage III\u2014hyperinflammation phase. Once the patients enter stage III, it will likely need ventilation and it becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to find therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease toward stage III. The key event leading to hyperinflammation seems to be the activation of Th-17 immunity response and Cytokine storm. B2-adrenergic receptors (B2ARs) are expressed on airways and on all the immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes. Blocking (B2AR) has been proven, also in clinical settings, to reduce Th-17 response and negatively modulate inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 while increasing IFN\u03b3.

To explore the underlying mechanism of immunomodulatory activities of AEAR, DCs were produced from bone-marrow cells of mice and the effects of AEAR on cell viability were assessed by the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) method and annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays. Then, the effects of AEAR on the morphology, maturation, and function of DCs were detected using a microscope, flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterization, and endocytosis assays. The secretion levels of cytokines were then analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation state of DCs was evaluated by the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The activity of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB pathways, which were involved in the regulation of AEAR on DCs, was further detected by Western blot. AEAR did not have a cytotoxic effect on DCs or mouse splenocytes. AEAR remarkably enhanced the phenotypic maturation of DCs and promoted the expression of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines in DCs. AEAR also significantly decreased the phagocytic ability of DCs and augmented the abilities of DCs to present antigens and stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Simultaneously, AEAR potently activated toll-like receptor (TLR)4-/TLR2-related MAPKs and induced the degradation of I\u03baB and the translocation of NF-\u03baB.

The disease continues to pose a major therapeutic challenge. Patient mortality is ultimately caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome (or \u201ccytokine storm\u201d) is likely to be a contributing factor to ARDS in many patients. Because interleukin 6 (IL-6) is known to play a key role in inflammation, IL-6 receptor inhibitors such as tocilizumab may potentially treat COVID-19 by attenuating cytokine release. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with severe COVID-19, on the verge of meeting intubation requirements, who needed progressive oxygen support for respiratory distress. The patient was treated with a non-weight-based dosage of tocilizumab to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm. We chose to administer an IL-6 inhibitor because of the gradually increasing levels of acute phase reactants identified on serial blood draws, as well as his declining respiratory status. The treatment was well-tolerated in conjunction with standard drug therapies for COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc). The patient subsequently experienced marked improvements in his respiratory symptoms and overall clinical status over the following days. We believe that tocilizumab played a substantial role in his ability to avert clinical decline, particularly the need for mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, the patient was downgraded from the ICU and discharged within days. We highlight the potential of IL-6 inhibitors to prevent the progression of respiratory disease to a point requiring ventilator support. This case underscores the potential importance of early serial measurements of IL-6 and cytokine storm-associated acute phase reactants, such as ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, in guiding clinical decision-making in the management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Conclusion: The early, proactive identification of serum acute phase reactants should be implemented in the treatment of COVID-19 in order to screen for a primary contributor to mortality\u2014the cytokine storm. This screening, when followed by aggressive early treatment for cytokine storm, may have optimal therapeutic benefits and obviate the need for mechanical ventilation, thereby decreasing mortality.

Activation of platelets lead to degranulation and release of contents into the plasma. Platelet activation is a common event in many viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), H1N1 influenza, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBV), and Dengue virus (DENV). The cytokines CXCL8, CCL5 (also known as Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted, RANTES), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), CXCL1/5 and CCL3 released, promote development of a pro-inflammatory state along with the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of infection. Platelets also interact with Monocytes and Neutrophils and facilitate their activation to release different cytokines which further enhances inflammation.

Cancer-related inflammation orchestrates the production of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines that perpetuate recruitment and activation of myeloid precursors, resulting in unresolved and chronic inflammation. This pathologic inflammation creates profound alterations in the intrinsic cellular metabolism of the myeloid progenitor pool, which is amplified by competition for essential nutrients and by hypoxia-induced metabolic rewiring at the tumor site. Therefore, persistent myelopoiesis and metabolic dysfunctions contribute to the development of cancer, as well as to the severity of a broad range of diseases, including metabolic syndrome and autoimmune and infectious diseases. The aims of this review are to (1) define the metabolic networks implicated in aberrant myelopoiesis observed in cancer patients, (2) discuss the mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations and the impact of metabolic perturbations on clinical outcomes, and (3) explore new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to restore immunometabolism and differentiation of myeloid cells towards an effector phenotype to increase host antitumor immunity.

This critical review was conducted to understand COVID-19 disease and highlights the prevailing facts that link phototherapy utilisation as a potential treatment modality for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The results demonstrated phototherapy\u2019s efficacy in regulating cytokines and inflammatory mediators, increasing angiogenesis and enhancing healing in chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. In conclusion, this review answered the following research question. Which molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of phototherapy have demonstrated great potential in enhancing the immune response and reducing host\u2013viral interaction in COVID-19 patients? Therefore, phototherapy is a promising treatment modality, which needs to be validated further for COVID-19 by robust and rigorous randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials to evaluate its impartial outcomes and safety."], "7532023": ["Aritra Saha, Prajna Anirvan", "7532023", "Cancer progression in COVID-19: integrating the roles of renin angiotensin aldosterone system, angiopoietin-2, heat shock protein-27 and epithelial mesenchymal transition", "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions worldwide and has been found to cause severe disease in patients with underlying comorbidities.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) mediated cellular entry of SARS-Cov2 leads to receptor shedding of ACE-2 and disrupts the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis (RAAS). This augments the pro-inflammatory and proliferative effects of RAAS, while attenuating the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative angiotensin 1-7 /Mas pathway. Angiopoietin-2, a molecule responsible for angiogenesis and cancer progression which corelates with tumour load in certain cancers, is upregulated by angiotensin 2-AT1 Receptor axis.

Additionally, Stress-NbA chronically potentiates systemic inflammation (from hematopoietic system activation with myelopoiesis) increasing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and setting the stage for stress-related chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs).\nThis process was propelled by overactivation of immune cell gene expression in the nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation pathway and underactivation of gene expression in the anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) pathway.

Severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 cause extreme increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that may lead to multi-organ damage and respiratory failure. Currently, no specific treatment and authorized vaccines are available for its treatment. Renin angiotensin system holds a promising role in human physiological system specifically in regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Renin angiotensin system by utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for its cellular entry. This interaction hampers the protective action of ACE2 in the cells and causes injuries to organs due to persistent angiotensin II (Ang-II) level. Patients with certain comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are under the high risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Moreover, evidence obtained from several reports also suggests higher susceptibility of male patients for COVID-19 mortality and other acute viral infections compared to females.

The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis.

This is why some COVID-19 patients need intensive care. The inflammatory chemicals released during COVID-19 infection cause the liver to produce proteins that defend the body from infections.

Closely related laboratory strains of T3D, originating from the same ancestral T3D isolate, were recently found to exhibit significantly different oncolytic properties. Specifically, the T3DPL strain had faster replication kinetics in a panel of cancer cells and improved tumor regression in an in vivo melanoma model, relative to T3DTD. In this study, we discover that T3DPL and T3DTD also differentially activate host signalling pathways and downstream gene transcription. At equivalent infectious dose, T3DTD induces higher IRF3 phosphorylation and expression of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) than T3DPL. Using mono-reassortants with intermediate replication kinetics and pharmacological inhibitors of reovirus replication, IFN responses were found to inversely correlate with kinetics of virus replication. In other words, slow-replicating T3D strains induce more IFN signalling than fast-replicating T3D strains. Paradoxically, during co-infections by T3DPL and T3DTD, there was still high IRF3 phosphorylation indicating a phenodominant effect by the slow-replicating T3DTD. Using silencing and knock-out of RIG-I to impede IFN, we found that IFN induction does not affect the first round of reovirus replication but does prevent cell-cell spread in a paracrine fashion. Accordingly, during co-infections, T3DPL continues to replicate robustly despite activation of IFN by T3DTD. Using gene expression analysis, we discovered that reovirus can also induce a subset of genes in a RIG-I and IFN-independent manner; these genes were induced more by T3DPL than T3DTD. Polymorphisms in reovirus \u03c33 viral protein were found to control activation of RIG-I/ IFN-independent genes. Altogether, the study reveals that single amino acid polymorphisms in reovirus genomes can have large impact on host gene expression, by both changing replication kinetics and by modifying viral protein activity, such that two closely related T3D strains can induce opposite cytokine landscapes."], "7526004": ["Wenchao Li, Weiwei Chen, Saisai Huang, Genhong Yao, Xiaojun Tang, Lingyun Sun", "7526004", "Mesenchymal stem cells prevent overwhelming inflammation and reduce infection severity via recruiting CXCR3+ regulatory T cells", "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown great potential in treating autoimmune diseases (ADs).

Adoptive transfer of Tregs isolated from MSC\u2010treated mice offered similar protection, while deletion of Tregs abrogated the protective effects of MSCs.

The clear common thread among the top risk groups\u2014vitamin D deficiency\u2014may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits. However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent. Early researchers reported three striking patterns. Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked \u201cRenin-Angiotensin\u201d System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19's deadly \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (dramatic immune system overreaction). Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency. This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency. Both within the USA and throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources. Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action. The 141 author groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work. COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4,000 IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1,000 IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities. Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies). Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes. Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions. The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe. Widely recommending 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives."], "7508582": ["Natalia Fintelman-Rodrigues, Carolina Q.

Because IL-6 is a relevant cytokine in acute respiratory distress syndrome, the blockade of its receptor with tocilizumab (TCZ) could reduce mortality and/or morbidity in severe COVID-19.\nWe sought to determine whether baseline IL-6 serum levels can predict the need for IMV and the response to TCZ.\nA retrospective observational study was performed in hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with preadministration and postadministration of TCZ. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, or mortality.\nOne hundred forty-six patients were studied, predominantly males (66%); median age was 63 years. Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ. IL-6 levels greater than 30 pg/mL was the best predictor for IMV (odds ratio, 7.1; P\u00a0< .001). Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement in oxygenation (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio) in patients with high IL-6 (P\u00a0= .048).

CD4+ T-cell differentiation sits at the center of this axis. Differentiation toward T-helper 1 (Th1) cells mediates inflammation and pathogen clearance, while T follicular helper (Tfh) cells facilitate germinal center (GC) reactions for the generation of high-affinity antibodies and immune memory. While Th1 and Tfh differentiation occurs in parallel, these CD4+ T-cell identities are mutually exclusive, and progression toward these ends is determined via the upregulation of T-bet and Bcl6, respectively. These lineage-defining transcription factors act in concert with multiple networks of transcriptional regulators that tip the T-bet and Bcl6 axis in CD4+ T-cell progenitors to either a Th1 or Tfh fate. It is now clear that these transcriptional networks are guided by cytokine cues that are not only varied between distinct viral infections but also dynamically altered throughout the duration of infection. Thus, multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors combine to specify the fate, plasticity, and function of Th1 and Tfh cells during infection. Here, we review the current information on the mode of action of the lineage-defining transcription factors Bcl6 and T-bet and how they act individually and in complex to govern CD4+ T-cell ontogeny.

However, clinical criteria specifically to define COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) have not been established. We aimed to develop and validate diagnostic criteria for cHIS in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19.\nWe searched for clinical research articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 20, 2020, on features and diagnostic criteria for secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, macrophage activation-like syndrome of sepsis, cytokine release syndrome, and COVID-19. We compared published clinical data for COVID-19 with clinical features of other hyperinflammatory or cytokine storm syndromes. Based on a framework of conserved clinical characteristics, we developed a six-criterion additive scale for cHIS: fever, macrophage activation (hyperferritinaemia), haematological dysfunction (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), hepatic injury (lactate dehydrogenase or asparate aminotransferase), coagulopathy (D-dimer), and cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or triglycerides). We then validated the association of the cHIS scale with in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in consecutive patients in the Intermountain Prospective Observational COVID-19 (IPOC) registry who were admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19.

It was already shown to inhibit growth and pathogenic mechanisms of a variety of enveloped RNA viruses and it was now found that circulating H2S is higher in Covid 19 survivors compared to fatal cases. H2S release is triggered by carbon monoxide (CO) from the catabolism of heme by inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heme proteins possess catalytic activity necessary for the H2S signalling by protein persulfidation. Subjects with a long promoter for the HMOX1 gene, coding for HO-1, are predicted for lower efficiency of this mechanism. SARS-cov-2 exerts ability to attack the heme of hemoglobin and other heme-proteins thus hampering both release and signalling of H2S. Lack of H2S-induced persulfidation of the KATP channels of leucocytes causes adhesion and release of the inflammatory cytokines, lung infiltration and systemic endothelial damage with hyper-coagulability. These events largely explain the sex and age distribution, clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of Covid-19. The understanding of this mechanism may be of guidance in re-evaluating the ongoing therapeutic strategies, with special attention to the interaction with mechanical ventilation, paracetamol and chloroquine use, and in the individuation of genetic traits causing increased susceptibility to the disruption of these physiologic processes and to a critical Covid 19.

Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for 24\u00a0h to PM2.5-1 (particle aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm) and subsequently for an additional 24\u00a0h to lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR3), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR7/8) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM2.5-1 produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR4 ligand than cells exposed to PM2.5-1 or bacterial ligand alone. On the contrary, PM2.5-1 exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR3 and TLR7/8. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G2-M phase arrest. Contrarily, bacterial stimulation caused a slight increase in cells in the sub-G1 phase but in PM2.5-1 primed co-cultures the effect of bacterial stimulation was masked by PM2.5-1.

The virus induces a strong T and B cell response but little is known about the immune pathology of this viral infection. Acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria also causes acute clinical illness and is characterized by hyperinflammation due to the strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a massive activation of T cells. In malaria, T cells express a variety of co-inhibitory receptors which might be a consequence of their activation but also might limit their overwhelming function. Thus, T cells are implicated in protection as well as in pathology. The outcome of malaria is thought to be a consequence of the balance between co-activation and co-inhibition of T cells. Following the hypothesis that T cells in COVID-19 might have a similar, dual function, we comprehensively characterized the differentiation (CCR7, CD45RO) and activation status (HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, CD226), the co-expression of co-inhibitory molecules (PD1, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, TIGIT), as well as the expression pattern of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells of PBMC of n = 20 SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to n = 10 P. falciparum infected patients and n = 13 healthy controls. Overall, acute COVID-19 and malaria infection resulted in a comparably elevated activation and altered differentiation status of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations. T effector cells of COVID-19 and malaria patients showed higher frequencies of the inhibitory receptors T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) which was linked to increased activation levels and an upregulation of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes. COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease course showed higher levels of LAG-3 and TIM-3 than patients with a mild disease course. During recovery, a rapid normalization of these inhibitory receptors could be observed.

That paradox has important practical implications for the use of the drug Tocilizumab in Covid-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) orchestrates the so-called cytokine storm leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the life-threatening condition that is responsible for Covid-19 deaths. However, IL-6 has a paradoxical effect in many viral infections. For pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B for example, high elevations show a toxic effect and are associated with higher mortality (e.g. they promote progression to AIDS in HIV patients), whereas mild elevations show a protective effect. IL-6 can be therefore considered as being both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Several studies have shown that severe COPD is associated with extremely-high levels of IL-6, whereas mild COPD is associated with mild elevations of IL-6. It is plausible that the chronic, mildly-elevated concentrations of IL-6 found in mild COPD patients is protective against the deterioration of Covid-19, as it is the case for other viral diseases. That may explain why COPD is surprisingly an uncommon comorbidity in Covid-19 intensive care units. This may have an important practical implication for the treatment of Covid-19 patients: our hypothesis is that Tocilizumab must be used exclusively in patients with an ongoing cytokine storm.

EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of\npro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2)\nregeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant\nproduction); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction\nproteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production).

A new classification will be provided for the immune system: \u201cretinoic acid-dependent component\u201d and \u201cretinoic acid non-dependent component\u201d. If this theory is verified, all the diseases where the retinoic acid metabolism is defective and retinoic acid levels are low will be identified and new approaches will be developed fortreating such diseases. When the need for retinoic acids increases, such as acute infection, high fever, severe catabolic process, or chronic antigenic stimulation, cytochrome oxidase enzymes are inhibited by drugs or internal mechanisms. Metabolism and excretion of retinoic acids stored in the liver are prevented. In this way, retinoic acid levels in the blood are raised to therapeutic levels. This is called \u201cEndogenous Retinoic Acid Theory\u201d. Retinoic acids also manage their metabolism through feedback mechanisms. Despite compensatory mechanisms, causes such as high fever, serious catabolic process and excessively large viral genome (SARS-CoV-2), excessive use of RIG-I and Type I interferon synthesis pathway using retinoic acid causes emptying of retinoic acid stores. As a result, the RIG-I pathway becomes ineffective, Type I IFN synthesis stops, and the congenital immune system collapses. Then the immune mechanism passes to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MDA5 and UPS pathways in the monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil and dendritic cells of the adaptive immune defense system that do not require retinoic acid. This leads to excessive TNF\u03b1 and cytokine discharge from the pathway. With the depletion of retinoic acid stores as a result of this overuse, the immune defense mechanism switches from the congenital immune system to the adaptive immune system, where retinoic acids cannot be used.

It ameliorated inflammatory responses and protected against acute lung inflammation in animal models. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a kind of inflammatory disease in which alveolar cells are damaged. However, a network pharmacology study to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms preventing ALI has not been performed.\nIn this study, we examined the main active ingredients in LJF and the protective effects of LJF on LPS-induced ALI in rats.\nFirst, the main active ingredients of LJF were screened in the TCMSP database, and the ALI-associated targets were collected from the GeneCards database. Then, we used compound-target and target-pathway networks to uncover the preventive mechanisms of LJF. Furthermore, we assessed the preventive effects of LJF in an LPS-induced rat model with the RNA-Seq technique to validate the possible molecular mechanisms of the effects of LJF in the treatment of ALI.\nThe network pharmacology results identified 28 main active compounds in LJF, and eight chemical components highly related to the potential targets, which were potential active compounds in LJF.

Recommendations for \u201csocial distancing\u201d and the fear of patients becoming infected during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 \u2013 April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In order to maintain in-office consultation services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide experience-based instructions in the future. Conclusion: The use of biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.

In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation.

COVID-19 induces an inflammatory response and, in severe cases, a cytokine storm that can damage the CNS. Antimalarials have unique properties that distinguish them from other anti-inflammatory drugs. (A) They are very lipophilic, which enhances their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Hence, they have the potential to act not only in the periphery but also in the CNS, and could be a useful addition to our limited armamentarium against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (B) They are non-selective inhibitors of phospholipase A2 isoforms, including cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The latter is not only activated by cytokines but itself generates arachidonic acid, which is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Free radicals are produced in this process, which can lead to oxidative damage to the CNS. There are at least 4 ways that antimalarials could be useful in combating COVID-19. (1) They inhibit PLA2. (2) They are basic molecules capable of affecting the pH of lysosomes and inhibiting the activity of lysosomal enzymes. (3) They may affect the expression and Fe2+/H+ symporter activity of iron transporters such as divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), hence reducing iron accumulation in tissues and iron-catalysed free radical formation. (4) They would affect viral replication. The latter may be related to their effect on inhibition of PLA2 isoforms.

We focus on the syncytium, the barrier between mother and fetus, and describe in detail its physical and structural defense against viral infections. We further discuss the potential molecular mechanisms, whereby the placenta serves as a defense front against pathogens by regulating the interferon type III signaling, microRNA-triggered autophagy and the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway. Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies.

The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals.

Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 recruits the inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in the adipose tissue; however, the mechanisms promoting the MIP-1\u03b1 expression remain unclear. We hypothesized that MIP-1\u03b1 co-induced by palmitate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in monocytic cells/macrophages could be further enhanced in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress. To investigate this, THP-1 monocytic cells and primary human macrophages were co-stimulated with palmitate and TNF-\u03b1 and mRNA and protein levels of MIP-1\u03b1 were measured by using quantitative reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), respectively. The cognate receptor of palmitate, toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, was blunted by genetic ablation, neutralization, and chemical inhibition. The involvement of TLR4-downstream pathways, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 or myeloid differentiation (MyD)-88 factor, was determined using IRF3-siRNA or MyD88-deficient cells. Oxidative stress was induced in cells by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment and ROS induction was measured by dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. The data show that MIP-1\u03b1 gene/protein expression was upregulated in cells co-stimulated with palmitate/TNF-\u03b1 compared to those stimulated with either palmitate or TNF-\u03b1 (P < 0.05). Further, TLR4-IRF3 pathway was implicated in the cooperative induction of MIP-1\u03b1 in THP-1 cells, and this cooperativity between palmitate and TNF-\u03b1 was clathrin-dependent and also required signaling through c-Jun and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB). Notably, ROS itself induced MIP-1\u03b1 and could further promote MIP-1\u03b1 secretion together with palmitate and TNF-\u03b1.

Adverse events, duration of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, length of hospitalization, serial chest computed tomography (CT) images, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, dynamics of cytokines, and IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed. No serious UC-MSCs infusion-associated adverse events were observed. Two patients receiving UC-MSCs developed transient facial flushing and fever, and one patient developed transient hypoxia at 12\u2009h post UC-MSCs transfusion.

Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, and we therefore prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severely ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term at the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China.\nMethods: In this single-centered, prospective, and observational study, we enrolled 114 severely ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020, to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were recorded, and the risk factors for poor outcome were analyzed.\nResults: Among the 114 enrolled patients with a mean age of 63.96 \u00b1 13.41 years, 94 (82.5%) patients were classified as a good outcome group. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with the good outcome group, 20 (17.5%) patients in the poor outcome group more frequently exhibited lymphopenia, and lower levels of albumin, partial arterial oxygen pressure, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, hypersensitive troponin I, C-reactive protein, ferritin, blood urea nitrogen, and D-dimer, as well as markedly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD8 + T cells, decreased in almost all the patients and were markedly lower in the poor outcome group than the good outcome group. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from a severe to mild condition. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of potential factors for poor outcome patients indicated that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction are related to the development of a poor outcome.\nConclusion: In summary, we reported this single-centered, prospective, and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19.

One field of research nowadays is to identify and treat viral-induced hyperinflammation with drugs used in other clinical conditions characterized by an hyperinflammation status. These drugs might help to reduce COVID19 mortality.\nMethods: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has been successfully used to treat severe immune-mediated diseases, such as graft vs. host disease and Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We used ruxolitinib in 18 patients with clinically progressive COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a primary endpoint to rapidly reduce the degree of respiratory impairment and as a secondary endpoint to rapidly restore the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, as an evaluation of clinical status, and monitoring of drug related Adverse Events. Parameters of inflammation responses and organ functions were assessed and monitored. The treatment plan was ruxolitinib 20 mg bid for the first 48 h and subsequent two-step de-escalation at 10 mg bid and 5 mg bid for a maximum of 14 days of treatment.\nResults: Our data collection shows a rapid clinical response with no evolution from non-invasive ventilation to mechanical ventilation in 16/18 patients and no response in two patients (overall response rate\u2014ORR 89%). Already after 48 h of ruxolitinib treatment 16/18 patients showed evident clinical improvement, and after 7 days of treatment 11/18 patients showed fully recovered respiratory function (pO2 > 98% in spontaneous breathing), 4/18 patients had minimal oxygen requirement (2\u20134 L/m), 1/18 patient showed stable disease, and 2/18 patient showed progressive disease.

Transfection of the murine form of STAT2 into STAT2-deficient human cells conferred resistance to STAT2 inhibition. Finally, we sought to understand the in vivo role of STAT2 by infecting hSTAT2 knock-in mice with HMPV, and found that mice had increased weight loss, inhibition of type I interferon signaling, and a Th2-polarized cytokine profile compared to WT mice.

To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2).

Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm.

The pathway is consistent with a broad range of observed clinical features and biological markers and captures key mediators of pathophysiology. In this proposed pathway, membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus via ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary type-II pneumocytes, provoke an initial immune response featuring inflammatory cytokine production coupled with a weak interferon response, particularly in IFN-\u03bb\u2013dependent epithelial defense. Differentiation of non-classic pathogenic T-cells and pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes contributes to a skewed inflammatory profile, mediated by membrane-bound immune receptor subtypes (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIA) and downstream signaling pathways (e.g., NF-\u03baB p65 and p38 MAPK), followed by chemotactic infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissue. Endothelial barrier degradation and capillary leakage contribute to alveolar cell damage. Inflammatory cytokine release, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and NETosis contribute to pulmonary thrombosis and cytokine storm. These mechanisms are concordant with observed clinical markers in COVID-19, including high expression of inflammatory cytokines on the TNF-\u03b1/IL-6 axis, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), diffuse alveolar damage via cell apoptosis in respiratory epithelia and vascular endothelia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP, high production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), depressed platelet count, and thrombosis. Although certain elements are likely to be revised as new findings emerge, the proposed pathway suggests multiple points of investigation for potential therapeutic interventions. Initial candidate interventions include prophylaxis to augment epithelial defense (e.g., AT1 receptor blockade, type III and type I interferons, melatonin, calcitriol, camostat, and lopinavir) and to reduce viral load (e.g., remdesivir, ivermectin, emetine, Abelson kinase inhibitors, dopamine D2 antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators). Additional interventions focus on tempering inflammatory signaling and injury (e.g., dexamethasone, doxycycline, Ang1-7, estradiol, alpha blockers, and DHA/EPA, pasireotide), as well as inhibitors targeted toward molecular mediators of the maladaptive COVID-19 immune response (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, JAK, and CDK9)."], "7399203": ["Eugenijus Kaniusas, Jozsef C.

Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response.

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2\u2032) within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high-end viral diagnostics. However, home-based point-of-care diagnostics are still under development, which may prove transformative in current COVID-19 pandemic containment. Similarly, vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 are currently in the pipeline for clinical trials.

Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment.

Like the human gammaherpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) establishes and maintains latency in the memory B cells during infection of laboratory mice. We have previously shown that MHV68 can immortalize fetal liver-derived B cells that induce lymphomas when injected into immunodeficient mice. Here we identify interleukin 16 (IL16) as a most abundantly expressed cytokine in MHV68-immortalized B cells and show that MHV68 infection elevates IL16 expression. IL16 is not important for MHV68 lytic infection but plays a critical role in MHV68 reactivation from latency. IL16 deficiency increases MHV68 lytic gene expression in MHV68-immortalized B cells and enhances reactivation from splenic latency. Correlatively, IL16 deficiency increases the frequency of MHV68-infected plasma cells that can be attributed to enhanced MHV68 reactivation. Furthermore, similar to TPA-mediated lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, IL16 deficiency markedly induces Tyr705 STAT3 de-phosphorylation and elevates p21 expression, which can be counteracted by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. Importantly, orthovanadate strongly blocks MHV68 lytic gene expression mediated by IL16 deficiency.

In this paper we analyze the efficacy of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea leaves and a well-known antioxidant, in counteracting autoimmune diseases, which are dominated by a massive cytokines production. Indeed, many studies registered that EGCG inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) transcription factors, whose activities are crucial in a multiplicity of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Importantly, the safety of EGCG/green tea extract supplementation is well documented in many clinical trials, as discussed in this review. Since EGCG can restore the natural immunological homeostasis in many different autoimmune diseases, we propose here a supplementation therapy with EGCG in COVID-19 patients. Besides some antiviral and anti-sepsis actions, the major EGCG benefits lie in its anti-fibrotic effect and in the ability to simultaneously downregulate expression and signaling of many inflammatory mediators.

High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI.

Fluorescent polarization and native MS approaches showed that BK1.1 binds CCL8, CCL7, and CCL18 and disrupts CCL8 homodimerization. We show that a BK1.1 derivative, BK1.3, has substantially improved ability to disrupt P672 binding to CCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 in an AlphaScreen assay.

Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-\u03b3, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities.

With a high safety profile, EPO promotes the production of endothelial progenitor cells and reduce inflammatory processes through inhibition of the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in human vascular endothelium, respiratory epithelium, and other cell types, and is thought to be a primary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. In physiological condition, ACE2 via its carboxypeptidase activity generates angiotensin fragments (Ang 1\u20139 and Ang 1\u20137), and plays an essential role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is a critical regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 via its surface spike glycoprotein interacts with ACE2 and invades the host cells. Once inside the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stimulates immune response (i.e., cytokine storm) and vascular damage. SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial cell injury could exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of aging, hypertension, and obesity, leading to further complications. The pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and injury offers insights into COVID-19 associated mortality. Here we reviewed the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the roles of ACE2, RAS signaling, and a possible link between the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial injury in COVID-19 associated mortality.

We investigated anti-inflammatory properties of the natural alkaloid tryptanthrin (TRYP) and its synthetic derivative tryptanthrin-6-oxime (TRYP-Ox).

Thus, even though TRYP-Ox generally had a better in vitro profile, possibly due to its ability to inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both TRYP and TRYP-Ox were equally effective in inhibiting the clinical symptoms and damage associated with RA.

A total of 71 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing You\u2019an Hospital in China with either mild (53 patients) or severe (18 patients) disease were enrolled with 18 healthy volunteers. We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines, and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4\u20137 days over 1 month per patient using a bioplex multiplex immunoassay.\nRESULTS. We found that the chemokine RANTES (CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and is believed to originate from bat, quickly spread into a global pandemic. This RNA virus has a special affinity for porphyrins. It invades the cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and binds to hemoproteins, resulting in a severe systemic inflammatory response, particularly in high ACE-2 organs like the lungs, heart, and kidney, resulting in systemic disease. The inflammatory response manifested by increased cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species results in inhibition of heme oxygenase (HO-1), with a subsequent loss of cytoprotection. This has been seen in other viral illness like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and SARS/MERS. There are a number of medications that have been tried with some showing early clinical promise. This illness disproportionately affects patients with obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease with a baseline excess of cytokines. The majority of the medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. This is further complicated by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, HO-1, ACE, and ACE-2. There is a potential role for HO-1 upregulation to treat/prevent cytokine storm.

Results: Nineteen RCTs were selected for review with a total of 1686 participants and a range of 32 to 252 participants within the studies.

Discrepancies between these guidelines reflect the altruistic wish to protect patients and lack of high\u2010quality evidence available to inform clinical practice. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the drug of choice for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with COVID\u201019. However, its utility in non\u2010pregnant patients is only established against venous thromboembolism, as LMWH may have little or no effect on immunothrombosis. Decisions about initiation and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation in the context of pregnancy and COVID\u201019 must take into consideration disease severity, outpatient vs inpatient status, temporal relation between disease occurrence and timing of childbirth, and the underlying prothrombotic risk conferred by additional comorbidities. There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH in thromboprophylaxis, which may increase bleeding risk without reducing thrombotic risk in pregnant patients with COVID\u201019. Likewise, there is no evidence to comment on the role of low\u2010dose aspirin in thromboprophylaxis or of anti\u2010cytokine and antiviral agents in preventing immunothrombosis.

The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases.

We hypothesize that this cytokine storm and the worsening of patients\u2019 health status can be dampened or even prevented by specifically targeting the vagal-driven cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). The CAP is a concept that involves an anti-inflammatory effect of vagal efferents by the release of acetylcholine (ACh).

Hence, targeting the \u03b17nAChRs through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could be of interest in the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, through the wide innervation of the organism by the vagus nerve, especially the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, VNS appears as a serious candidate for a few side effect treatment that could dampen or prevent the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms.

NE stimulates epithelial toll like receptors (TLR) resulting in cytokine upregulation and release, upregulates MUC5AC, a major airway mucin, degrades both phagocytic receptors and opsonins resulting in both neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic failure, generates oxidative stress via extracellular generation and uptake of heme free iron, and activates other proteases. Altogether, these mechanisms create a significant inflammatory challenge that impairs innate immune function and results in airway remodeling. Currently, a major gap in our therapeutic approach to CF lung disease is the lack of an effective therapeutic strategy targeting active NE and its downstream pro-inflammatory sequelae. Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are potent anti-elastase drugs that have additional anti-inflammatory properties. Heparin is a prototype of a glycosaminoglycan with both anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory properties. Heparin inhibits NE in an allosteric manner with high potency. Heparin also inhibits cathepsin G, blocks P-selectin and L-selectin, hinders ligand binding to the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, and impedes histone acetyltransferase activity which dampens cytokine transcription and High Mobility Group Box 1 release. Furthermore, nebulized heparin treatment improves outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, acute lung injury and smoke inhalation. However, the anticoagulant activity of heparin is a potential contraindication for this therapy to be developed for CF lung disease. Therefore, modified heparins and other GAGs are being developed that retain the anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory qualities of heparin with minimal to no anticoagulant activity. The modified heparin, 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH), maintains anti-elastase and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo, and has little residual anticoagulant activity. Heparan sulfate with O-sulfate residues but not N-sulfate residues blocks allergic asthmatic inflammation in a murine model. Polysulfated hyaluronic acid abrogates allergen- triggered rhinosinusitis in a murine model.

Most of the lung damage is driven by a surge in inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, and granulocyte-monocyte stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. Blunting this hyperinflammation with immunomodulation may lead to clinical improvement. GM-CSF is produced by many cells, including macrophages and T-cells. GM-CSF-derived signals are involved in differentiation of macrophages, including alveolar macrophages (AMs). In animal models of respiratory infections, the intranasal administration of GM-CSF increased the proliferation of AMs and improved outcomes. Increased levels of GM-CSF have been recently described in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. While GM-CSF might be beneficial in some circumstances as an appropriate response, in this case the inflammatory response is maladaptive by virtue of being later and disproportionate. The inhibition of GM-CSF signaling may be beneficial in improving the hyperinflammation-related lung damage in the most severe cases of COVID-19. This blockade can be achieved through antagonism of the GM-CSF receptor or the direct binding of circulating GM-CSF. Initial findings from patients with COVID-19 treated with a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab, a monoclonal antibody binding GM-CSF receptor \u03b1, showed oxygenation improvement and shorter hospitalization.

Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage.

The SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and macrophages can produce large amounts of numerous types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to local tissue inflammation and a dangerous systemic inflammatory response called cytokine storm. Both local tissue inflammation and the cytokine storm play a fundamental role in the development of COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a main cause of death in COVID-19 patients.

Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication.

In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states.\nFollowing the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients.

Secretory glands lose their functionality due to the infiltration of immune cells, which produce cytokines and cause inflammation. Primary SS is characterized by dry syndrome with or without systemic commitment in the absence of other pathologies. Secondary SS is accompanied by other autoimmune diseases with high activation of B lymphocytes and the production of autoantibodies, including the rheumatoid factor. Other cells, such as CD4+ T cells and mast cells (MCs), participate in SS inflammation. MCs are ubiquitous, but are primarily located close to blood vessels and nerves and can be activated early in autoimmune diseases to express a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines. In the SS acute phase, MCs react by generating chemical mediators of inflammation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-33. IL-33 is the specific ligand for ST2 capable of inducing some adaptive immunity TH2 cytokines but also has pro-inflammatory properties. IL-33 causes impressive pathological changes and inflammatory cell infiltration. IL-1 family members can have paracrine and autocrine effects by exacerbating autoimmune inflammation.

While required for protective immunity, infection-induced inflammation can be detrimental if it is not properly controlled, causing collateral body damage and potentially leading to death. It is in this context that the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is required to dampen the pro-inflammatory immune response that hallmarks trypanosomosis. Effective control of this infection requires not just the action of antibodies specific for the parasite's variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat antigens, but also a pro-inflammatory immune response mediated mainly by IFN\u03b3, TNF, and NO. However, strict control of inflammation is mandatory, as IL-10-deficient mice succumb from an unrestrained cytokine storm within 10 days of a Trypanosome brucei infection. The relevant cellular source of IL-10 and the associated molecular mechanisms implicated in its trypanosomosis associated production are poorly understood. Using an IL-10 reporter mouse strain (Vert-X), we demonstrate here that NK cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells as well as B cells and plasma cells constitute potential cellular sources of IL-10 within the spleen and liver during acute infection. The IL-10 wave follows peak pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which accompanied the control of peak parasitemia. Similar results were observed following conventional experimental needle infection and physiological infections via T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Our results show that conditional T cell-specific ablation of the IL-10 regulating Prdm1 gene (encoding for the Blimp-1 transcription factor), leads to an uncontrolled trypanosome-induced pro-inflammatory syndrome like the one observed in infected IL-10-deficient mice. This result indicates that the biological role of IL-10-derived from non-T cells, including NK cells, is of minor importance when considering host survival. The cytokine IL-27 that is also considered to be an IL-10 regulator, did not affect IL-10 production during infection. Together, these data suggest that T. brucei activates a Blimp-1-dependent IL-10 regulatory pathway in T cells that acts as a critical anti-inflammatory rheostat, mandatory for host survival during the acute phase of parasitemia."], "7324935": ["K.

Understanding the age-based differences in pathophysiological pathways and processes relevant to the onset and progression of disease both in the clinical course and in experimental disease models may hold the key to the identification of therapeutic targets. The differences in the clinical course are highlighted by the lack of progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond mild symptoms in a majority of children, whereas in adults the disease progresses to acute lung injury and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like phenotype with high mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to decreased lung injury in children may involve the decreased expression of the mediators necessary for viral entry into the respiratory epithelium and differences in the immune system responses in children. Specifically, decreased expression of proteins, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the airway epithelium in children may prevent viral entry. The immune system differences may include a relative preponderance of CD4+ T cells, decreased neutrophil infiltration, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased production of immunomodulatory cytokines in children compared with adults.

Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed\nin vivo\nin COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed an antiviral dose-response to remdesivir and demonstrated the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in human alveolar cells.

The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19.

The epitopes were channeled through a filtering pipeline comprised of antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility evaluation with the goal of selecting epitopes capable of generating both T and B cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking simulation between the epitopes and their corresponding MHC molecules was carried out. 13 epitopes, a highly immunogenic adjuvant, elements for proper sub-cellular trafficking, a secretion booster, and appropriate linkers were combined for constructing the vaccine.

The main objectives of this study are to determine the nature of interactions between VP and CDDP/CP/Taxol and to understand the mechanism of action of VP in OVCA cells.\nThe efficacy of VP on cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, invasion and clonogenic capacity was assayed in CDDP-sensitive (COV504, OV-90) and CDDP-resistant (A2780Cis) cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of drugs either alone or in combination were evaluated using MTT assay and Cell Viability Blue assay. The effects of drugs on the metabolic functions were studied using matrigel invasion assay and clonogenic assay. Immunoblot analysis was carried out to investigate changes in YAP and cell cycle genes. Changes in the cytokines due to drug treatments were analyzed using a cytokine array.\nTreatment with VP inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and increased cytotoxicity of OVCA cells.

Extensive research in the last decaderevealed that MSCs carry out most of their functions through paracrine factors which are soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs).

Common clinical manifestations of HLH are acute unremitting fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multiorgan failure. Due to a massive cytokine release, this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome. HPS has primary and acquired (secondary, reactive) forms. Its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and, therefore, is called familial HLH. Secondary HLH may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder, that is, secondary to a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune/autoinflammatory stimulus.

However, the effect of the altered metabolites of nuciferine on NAFLD has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we established a NAFLD rat model using HFD and treated with nuciferine. The lipid content levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress were investigated to access the therapeutic effects of nuciferine. Additionally, the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of nuciferine on NAFLD were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Gene expression of the key enzymes related to the changed metabolic pathways following nuciferine intervention was also investigated. The results showed that nuciferine treatment significantly reduced the body weight, levels of lipids, and liver enzymes in the blood and improved the hepatic steatosis in the NAFLD rat model. Nuciferine treatment also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and decreased the levels of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) in the liver. Nuciferine treatment decreased the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and upregulated the gene expression of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in the liver.

The genetic landscape of an individual in particular, and a population in general seems to play a pivotal role in shaping the above COVID\u201019 dynamics. Considering the implications of host genes in the entry and replication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and in mounting the host immune response, it appears that multiple genes might be crucially involved in the above processes. Herein, we propose three potentially important genetic gateways to COVID\u201019 infection; these could explain at least in part the discrepancies of its spread, severity, and mortality. The variations within Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene might constitute the first genetic gateway, influencing the spatial transmission dynamics of COVID\u201019. The Human Leukocyte Antigen locus, a master regulator of immunity against infection seems to be crucial in influencing susceptibility and severity of COVID\u201019 and can be the second genetic gateway.

MSC are large, adherent fibroblasts that sequester small HSPC and macrophage in the BM niche (Graphic abstract). High basal CYP1B1 expression in BMS2 cells derives from interactions between the Ah-receptor enhancer and proximal promoter SP1 complexes, boosted by autocrine signaling. PAH effects on BMS2 cells model Lepr+MSC niche activity. CYP1B1 metabolizes DMBA to PAHDE, producing p53-mediated mRNA increases, long after the in vivo HSPC suppression. Faster, direct p53 effects, favored by stem cells, remain possible PAHDE targets. However, HSPC regulatory factors remained unresponsive. BP is less toxic in BMS2 cells, but, in BM, CYP1A1 metabolism stimulates macrophage cytokines (Il1b\u00a0>\u00a0Tnfa> Ifng) within 6\u00a0h.

Then, the STRING database was applied to analyse protein\u2013protein interaction, and Cytoscape software was used to draw a network diagram. The R language and DAVID database were used to analyse GO biological processes and KEGG pathway enrichment. Second, AutoDock Vina and other software were used for molecular docking of core targets and core compounds. Finally, before and after application of DYY, the core target gene IL6 of COVID-19 patients was detected by ELISA to validate the clinical effects.\nFirst, 174 compounds, 7053 target genes of DYY and 251 genes related to COVID-19 were selected, among which there were 45 target genes of DYY associated with treatment of COVID-19. This study demonstrated that the use of DYY in the treatment of COVID-19 involved a variety of biological processes, and DYY acted on key targets such as IL6, ILIB, and CCL2 through signaling pathways such as the IL-17 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction. DYY might play a vital role in treating COVID-19 by suppressing the inflammatory storm and regulating immune function. Second, the molecular docking results showed that there was a certain affinity between the core compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, naringenin, formononetin) and core target genes (IL6, IL1B, CCL2). Finally, clinical studies showed that the level of IL6 was elevated in COVID-19 patients, and DYY can reduce its levels.\nDYY may treat COVID-19 through multiple targets, multiple channels, and multiple pathways and is worthy of clinical application and promotion."], "7286633": ["Domenico Birra, Maurizio Benucci, Luigi Landolfi, Anna Merchionda, Gabriella Loi, Patrizia Amato, Gaetano Licata, Luca Quartuccio, Massimo Triggiani, Paolo Moscato", "7286633", "COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity", "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our lives and has rapidly expanded to reach more than 4 million cases worldwide by May 2020.

In this study, we found that PEDV infection induced significant IFN-\u03bb expression in type I IFN-defective Vero E6 cells, but virus-induced endogenous IFN-\u03bb did not reduce PEDV titers.

The inhibition of IFN-\u03bb elicited ISGs expression by SOCS1 was specifically rescued by overexpression of miR-30c-5p.

The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and \u2018endotheliitis\u2019 in several organs including the heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification. In patients with elevated hs-troponin, clinical context is important and myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential, along with type I and type II myocardial infarction. Irrespective of etiology, patients with acute myocardial injury should be prioritized for treatment. Clinical decisions including interventions should be individualized and carefully tailored after thorough review of risks/benefits.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF\u03baB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated.

The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza.

It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms. Baseline pulmonary levels of anti-viral leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may orchestrate an effective early immune response and prevent severe symptoms. Using \u201cin silico flow cytometry\u201d, we deconvoluted the levels of all seven types of anti-viral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissues. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses, and in two independent datasets. Relevantly, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate in human cells and tissues. Above findings also largely apply to the SARS-CoV-2 entry protease TMPRSS2. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and COVID-19 lung tissues show upregulation of CD8+ T cell-and NK cell-recruiting cytokines. Moreover, tissue-resident CD8+ T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavages from mildly affected COVID-19 patients, compared to severe cases. This suggests that these lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection.

Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients.

MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBE\u2019s anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication.

As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost.

The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm.

We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid\u201019 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl\u2010coenzyme A (acetyl\u2010CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian \u201cresetting\u201d of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl\u2010CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N\u2010acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype.

Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should; therefore, be assessed for all patients. Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infections due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established a dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crises. We also integrated Chinese medicine in the treatment to promote rehabilitation. We optimized nursing processes for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.

H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza viruses\u2019 subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in lots of countries, resulting in great economic loss due to reduced egg production or high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens. These two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens to aggravate the disease, and often cause mixed infection in clinics. Co-infection of C. psittaci with H9N2 commonly induces severe pneumonia and high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. According to previous studies, we postulated that C. psittaci infection may beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11. Consequently, in this study, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11, which is the first study of the coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro.\nIn a pilot study, simultaneous infection with Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) and H9N2 virus induced 20% mortality and severe avian airsacculitis, shedding light on animal models of poultry respiratory diseases. However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that C. psittaci infection execrates macrophage function and facilitates H9N2 infection. To explore the potential mechanism, we studied the effect of C. psittaci and H9N2 on the functions of HD11 cells in vitro by simultaneous infection of C. psittaci and H9N2. At the same time, we used infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone as the control groups. The results showed that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to C. psittaci or H9N2 infection alone. In addition, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 did not induce high C. psittaci loads compared to C. psittaci infection alone at 12- and 24-hours post-inoculation (hpi), but coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could increase the loads of H9N2 compared to H9N2 alone in HD11 cells at 12 hpi. More importantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels, enzyme activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis were reduced significantly in the group with C. psittaci and H9N2 coinfection compared to those of H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Finally, C. psittaci infection induced robust expressions of type Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) displayed a significant decrease compared to H9N2 infection alone at 24 hpi.

We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by human NK cells that greatly exceeds resposes to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including TNF and GM-CSF. IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17) mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface.

This symptom-complex arises on the basis of chronic allergic inflammation of the airway wall. Consequently, the airway epithelium is central to the pathogenesis of this disease, because its multiple abilities directly have an impact on the inflammatory response and thus the formation of the disease. In turn, its structure and functions are markedly impaired by the inflammation. Hence, the airway epithelium represents a sealed, self-cleaning barrier, that prohibits penetration of inhaled allergens, pathogens, and other noxious agents into the body. This barrier is covered with mucus that further contains antimicrobial peptides and antibodies that are either produced or specifically transported by the airway epithelium in order to trap these particles and to remove them from the body by a process called mucociliary clearance. Once this first line of defense of the lung is overcome, airway epithelial cells are the first cells to get in contact with pathogens, to be damaged or infected. Therefore, these cells release a plethora of chemokines and cytokines that not only induce an acute inflammatory reaction but also have an impact on the alignment of the following immune reaction. In case of asthma, all these functions are impaired by the already existing allergic immune response that per se weakens the barrier integrity and self-cleaning abilities of the airway epithelium making it more vulnerable to penetration of allergens as well as of infection by bacteria and viruses. Recent studies indicate that the history of allergy- and pathogen-derived insults can leave some kind of memory in these cells that can be described as imprinting or trained immunity.

Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death.\nThese complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations.

It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage.\nExtracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood.

Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8+ lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals.

In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in\u00a0vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that RDV exhibited protective effects against NAFLD development mainly through repressing STING signaling, and thus could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy."], "7194613": ["Qing Ye, Bili Wang, Jianhua Mao", "7194613", "The pathogenesis and treatment of the `Cytokine Storm' in COVID-19", "Cytokine storm is a general term applied to maladaptive cytokine release in response to infection and other\u00a0stimuli.

Hence, to thwart the invasion by viruses, hosts have developed immunity in ascending stages\u2014intrinsic, innate and adaptive immunity. A robust intrinsic and innate immune response governs an effective adaptive immune response, should that be needed. Both enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses are subject to distinct types of DNA sensors, subject to their site of replication. DNA sensors of viral PAMPs can be classified into three types, based on the location of their PAMPs in the host cellular compartment viz. cell surface, cytoplasmic and nuclear. The host cell membrane both, surface as well as intra cellular, is continuously monitored for the non-host, pathogenic components or PAMPs. Among the intracellular sensors of the viral genome, there are two types\u2014essentially due to the two types of major viral genomes i.e. RNA and DNA sensors. The cytosolic DNA sensors include AIM2, IFI16, cGAS, RNA Pol III, DNA-PK, DDX9, DHX36, DDX41, DDX60, DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1 and MRE11. PYHIN family of sensors include AIM2, IFI16, IFIX and MNDA. Another recently discovered family of sensor called stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), specifically houses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions in association with its upstream sensor, cGAS. Some DNA sensors shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus pre- and post-extraneous DNA binding. These include IFI16, IFIX, RNA Pol III, etc. There is no exclusive nuclear DNA sensor. Many enzymes known to be present in the cells for their obvious primary functions also additionally function as DNA sensors. The DNAse family of sensors include DNAse II and TREX1, which are ubiquitously present in the cell for their housekeeping functions. The RNAse family of sensor includes one member\u2014RNA Pol III. Additionally, DNA-PK also functions to cater to viral DNA sensing. The endosomal DNA sensors include TLR7 and TLR9, which belong to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. The DExD/H-box helicase family include the putative DNA sensors recently discovered including DDX9, DHX36, DDX41 and DDX60.

The effector functions of T cells are mediated through cytokines/chemokines and by direct cytotoxicity of infected cells.

Persistent viral infections are associated with functionally suboptimal, exhausted T cell responses, which are unable to clear virus.

While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response.

As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection.\nWe utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been found to contribute to numerous severe clinical symptoms which result in death. The exact mechanism by which EV71 influences miR\u20109 expression is unknown, and the relationship between miR\u20109 and EV71 is still unclear. Here, miR\u20109 expression was found to be impaired upon EV71 infection in several cell lines and in an EV71 infection mouse model. Additionally, we confirmed that EV71 infection induces robust expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, and IL\u20101) and interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2). Overexpression of miR\u20109 attenuated EV71 proliferation and reduced protein and gene expressions of virion protein 1 (VP1) of EV71. Furthermore, we observed that the inflammation caused by EV71 infection was restored to a moderate level via miR\u20109 overexpression. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) in the retinoic acid\u2010induced gene 1 (RIG\u2010I) signaling pathway, but not interferon regulating factor 3 (IRF3), was significantly decreased and inactivated by ectopic miR\u20109 expression. Moreover, in mouse infection experiments, administration of miR\u20109 agomirs caused a significant decrease in VP1 levels and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine production after viral inoculation. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that miR\u20109 exerts an anti\u2010EV71 effect in cells and a mouse model via mediating NF\u03baB activity of the RIG\u2010I signal pathway, thereby suggesting a new candidate for antiviral drug development."], "5881172": ["Ran Wang, Md.

When protein secretion demand exceeds the protein folding capacity of the ER, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered as a consequence of ER stress. Due to the secretory function of epithelial cells, UPR plays an important role in maintaining epithelial barrier function at mucosal sites. ER stress and activation of the UPR are natural mechanisms by which mucosal epithelial cells combat viral infections. In this review, we discuss the important role of UPR in regulating mucosal epithelium homeostasis. In addition, we review current insights into how the UPR is involved in viral infection at mucosal barriers and potential therapeutic strategies that restore epithelial cell integrity following acute viral infections via cytokine and cellular stress manipulation."], "4402954": ["Jasper F.

Subsequent hunting for novel coronaviruses (CoVs) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 animal CoVs, including the prototype lineage C betacoronaviruses, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5; these are phylogenetically closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which has affected more than 1,000 patients with over 35% fatality since its emergence in 2012. All primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ failure. Antivirals with potent in vitro activities include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, interferons, mycophenolic acid, and lopinavir.

More recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents. The introduction of a targeted mutation in the IL2 receptor common gamma chain gene (IL2rgnull) in mice already deficient in T and B cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells, as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues, effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice. These humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and other human-specific infectious agents. However, there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents. This is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies, which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice, including; i) modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity, which impedes human cell engraftment; ii) genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function; iii) and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols.

While SARS-CoV infection has not recurred to a significant extent since 2003, it still remains a potential threat. Understanding of SARS and development of therapeutic approaches have been hampered by the absence of an animal model that mimics the human disease and is reproducible. Here we show that transgenic mice that express the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) in airway and other epithelia develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with a human strain of the virus. Infection begins in airway epithelia, with subsequent alveolar involvement and extrapulmonary virus spread to the brain. Infection results in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both the lung and the brain. This model of lethal infection with SARS-CoV should be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for the development of antiviral therapies."]}
