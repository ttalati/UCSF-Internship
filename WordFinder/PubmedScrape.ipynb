Although a variety of social, environmental, and maternal factors have been implicated in PTB, causes of preterm labor have remained largely unknown. There is evidence of effectiveness and safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, however fewer studies have looked at vaccination response as an indicator of an innate host response that may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      "There is increasing appreciation that the immune system plays critical roles not only in the traditional domains of infection and inflammation but also in many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one of the major barriers for understanding human immunological mechanisms is that immune assays have not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently large and diverse healthy human cohort. Here, we present the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP), a framework for growing a diverse human immunology reference, from ImmPort, a publicly available resource of subject-level immunology data. Although some measurement types are sparse in the presently deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP, we describe variations in serum cytokines and leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic changes in pregnancy. All data in the resource are available for visualization and download at http://10kimmunomes.org/.\n",

      "The magnitude of the immune response is closely associated with clinical outcome in patients with cancer. However, finding potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer in the immune system remains challenging. Here we constructed a vital immune-prognosis genes (VIPGs) based cluster of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from IMMPORT databases and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A transcription factor regulatory network for the VIPGs was also established. The tumor microenvironment of LUAD was analyzed using the ESTIMATE algorithm and single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The immune checkpoints and genomic alterations were explored in the different immune clusters. We identified fifteen VIPGs for LUAD patients and clustered the patients into low-immunity and high-immunity subtypes. The immune score, stromal score, and ESTIMATE score were significantly higher in the high-immunity subtype while tumor purity was higher in the low-immunity subtype. Additionally, the immune checkpoints CTLA4, PD1, and PDL1 were elevated in the low-immunity subtype. The genomic results also showed that the tumor mutation burden was higher in the high-immunity subtype. Finally, GSEA showed that several immune-related gene sets, including IL2/STAT5 signaling, inflammatory response, IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, interferon-gamma response and allograft rejection, were elevated in the high-immunity subtype. Finally, high-immunity patients exhibited greater overall and disease-specific survival outcome compared to low-immunity patients (Log-Rank P=0.013 and P=0.0097). Altogether, here we have identified fifteen immune-prognosis genes and a potential immune-subtype for LUAD patients, which may provide new insights into the prognosis and treatment of LUAD.\n",

Models composed of multiple genes usually predict the survival prognosis of patients more accurately than single genes. We can analyze the multigene models that can predict the prognosis of COAD from the current database.\n",

      "Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer, attracting increasing attention worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of patients with metastatic melanoma is low. Therefore, it is critical to identify potential effective biomarkers for diagnosis of melanoma metastasis. In the present study, the melanoma cohort and immune genes were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the ImmPort database, respectively. Then, we constructed the immune risk score (IRS) using univariate and multivariate logistic analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of IRS in sequencing samples and the initial diagnosis patients was 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. Besides, IRS could add benefits for metastasis diagnosis. For sequencing samples, IRS (OR = 16.35, 95% CI = 8.74-30.59) increased the odds for melanoma metastasis. Similar results were obtained in the initial diagnosis patients (OR = 8.93, 95% CI = 3.53-22.61). A composite nomogram was built based on IRS and clinical information with well-fitted calibration curves. We further used other independent melanoma cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to confirm the reliability and validity of the IRS (AUC > 0.75, OR > 1.04, and P value < 0.01 in all cohorts). In conclusion, IRS is significantly associated with melanoma metastasis and can be a novel effective signature for predicting the metastasis risk.\n",

      "Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain tumor, has a very poor outcome and high tumor recurrence rate. The immune system has positive interactions with the central nervous system. Despite many studies investigating immune prognostic factors, there is no effective model to identify predictive biomarkers for GBM. Genomic data and clinical characteristic information of patients with GBM were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazard modeling. Deseq2 software was used for differential expression analysis. Immune-related genes from ImmPort Shared Data and the Cistrome Project were evaluated. The model performance was determined based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. CIBERSORT was used to assess the infiltration of immune cells. The results of differential expression analyses showed a significant difference in the expression levels of 2942 genes, comprising 1338 upregulated genes and 1604 downregulated genes (p < 0.05). A population of 24 immune-related genes that predicted GBM patient survival was identified. A risk score model established on the basis of the expressions of the 24 immune-related genes was used to evaluate a favorable outcome of GBM. Further validation using the ROC curve confirmed the model was an independent predictor of GBM (AUC = 0.869). In the GBM microenvironment, eosinophils, macrophages, activated NK cells, and follicular helper T cells were associated with prognostic risk. Our study confirmed the importance of immune-related genes and immune infiltrates in predicting GBM patient prognosis.\n",

      "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common pathological subtype of renal cell carcinoma, and immune-related genes (IRGs) are key contributors to its development. In this study, the gene expression profiles and clinical data of ccRCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the cBioPortal database, respectively. IRGs were obtained from the ImmPort database. We analyzed the expression of IRGs in ccRCC, and discovered 681 that were differentially expressed between ccRCC and normal kidney tissues. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic differentially expressed IRGs (PDEIRGs). Using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we detected seven optimal PDEIRGs (PLAU, ISG15, IRF9, ARG2, RNASE2, SEMA3G and UCN) and used them to construct a risk model to predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. This model accurately stratified patients with different survival outcomes and precisely identified patients with different mutation burdens. Our findings suggest the seven PDEIRGs identified in this study are valuable prognostic predictors in ccRCC patients. These genes could be used to investigate the developmental mechanisms of ccRCC and to design individualized treatments for ccRCC patients.\n",

      "We investigated the local immune status and its prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.\n",

      "The kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) is a relatively rare type of kidney cancer. There has been no investigation to find a robust signature to predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients in the aspect of tumor immunology. In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways. In conclusion, our study constructs a robust 15-gene signature for predicting KIRP patients' survival outcome on the basis of tumor immune environment and may provide possible relationship between prognosis and immune-related biological function.\n",

      "The frequency and duration of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) ocular infections decrease with age, suggesting development of partial immunity. However, there is a lack of clear correlates of immunity to Ct infection in humans. We screened sera from a cohort of Gambian children followed for six-months against a Ct-proteome microarray. At genome sequence level, we detected signatures of selection from a population of ocular Ct isolates from Guinea-Bissau. Together these approaches allowed us to highlight the focus of humoral responses and hypothesise new modes of pathogen immune evasion. Children who were susceptible to frequent and/or prolonged Ct infection had a less focussed antibody response, including preferential recognition of forty-two antigens. There was evidence of positive and purifying selection across the genome, but little balancing selection. In contrast, most antigens that were associated with susceptibility were under neutral selection. These data suggest an evasion strategy in which Ct presents a large panel of irrelevant antigens to the immune system to block or misdirect protective responses. Development of a focused immune response, possibly induced through vaccination, may be an effective strategy to promote protection to Ct infection.\n",

Twenty-five female macaques were infected with C. trachomatis serovars D or E in the cervix and/or fallopian tubes. Bloods were collected at baseline and at various intervals after challenge.

TC0582 was also formulated in combination with TC0580, TC0581 or MOMP. TC0582 alone, or in combination with the other antigens, elicited strong Chlamydia-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.

Based on percentage change in body weight, lung weight, and number of Chlamydia inclusion forming units recovered from the lungs, mice immunized with TC0582, TC0581 or MOMP, as single antigens, showed significant protection. Mice immunized with combinations of two antigens were also protected but the level of protection was not additive. TC0582 has sequence homology with the eukaryotic ATP synthase subunit A (AtpA). Therefore, to determine if immunization with TC0582, or with Chlamydia, elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with the mouse AtpA, the two proteins were printed on a microarray.

Identification of protective antigens is required to implement a subunit vaccine. To identify potential antigen vaccine candidates, three strains of mice, BALB/c, C3H/HeN and C57BL/6, were inoculated with live and inactivated C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) by different routes of immunization. Using a protein microarray, serum samples collected after immunization were tested for the presence of antibodies against specific chlamydial antigens. A total of 225 open reading frames (ORF) of the C. trachomatis genome were cloned, expressed, and printed in the microarray. Using this protein microarray, a total of seven C. trachomatis dominant antigens were identified (TC0052, TC0189, TC0582, TC0660, TC0726, TC0816 and, TC0828) as recognized by IgG antibodies from all three strains of animals after immunization. In addition, the microarray was probed to determine if the antibody response exhibited a Th1 or Th2 bias. Animals immunized with live organisms mounted a predominant Th1 response against most of the chlamydial antigens while mice immunized with inactivated Chlamydia mounted a Th2-biased response.
